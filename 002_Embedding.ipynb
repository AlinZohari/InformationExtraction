    "The difference and advantages of tuning over indexing:\n",
    "- New documents are available in real-time, compared to tuning, which might require a couple of hours.\n",
    "- We circumvent the context size limitations. Most LLMs allow around 4000 tokens per request. This makes it impossible to provide a large amount of data. With the Indexing approach, our LLM can rely on unlimited data because of the retrieval of similar documents we only sent the relevant ones.\n",
    "- Restricted documents that aren’t supposed to be available for everyone can be filtered on runtime. Compared to tuning that does not know anything about access restrictions to documents.\n",
    "- Cheaper because no LLM fine-tuning is required.\n",
    "- Explainable due to the underlying data, this helps to verify if an answer is correct if needed. We know the truth.\n",
    "- Combined with prompt engineering, we can avoid hallucinations."

      "III. DISCUSSION\n",
      "9. After review of the record, we conclude that grant of the Kuiper application will serve the public interest, subject to the requirements and conditions specified herein.  The broadband services Kuiper proposes to provide will benefit American consumers.  Below, we address Kuiper’s requests to operate in various Ka-band frequencies for both MSS and FSS, power limit compliance, orbital debris mitigation, the various issues raised by commenters, and Kuiper’s waiver requests.  \n",
      "A. FSS Operations in the Ka-Band \n",
      "10. We grant Kuiper’s requests to deploy and operate an NGSO system to provide service using certain FSS Ka-band frequencies with conditions adopted herein.\n",
      "11. Space-to-Earth Operations in the 18.8-19.3 GHz and Earth-to-Space Operations in the 28.6-29.1 GHz Bands.  We grant Kuiper’s request to operate in the 18.8-19.3 GHz and 28.6-29.1 GHz bands, since the request is consistent with the Commission’s Ka-band Plan that designates these frequency bands for NGSO FSS operations on a primary basis. Update to Parts 2 and 25 Concerning Non-Geostationary, Fixed-Satellite Service Systems and Related Matters, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd 7809, Appendix B (2017) (NGSO FSS Order).\n",
      "  \n",
      "12. Space-to-Earth Operations in the 17.7-17.8 GHz Band (outside of the United States).  Under the U.S. Table of Frequency Allocations (U.S. Table) the 17.7-17.8 band is allocated to the Fixed Service (FS) on a primary basis and FSS (Earth-to-space) for Broadcasting-Satellite Service feeder links.  Internationally, however, this band is allocated for FSS (space-to-Earth) in all regions.  Kuiper proposes to use this band for user downlinks internationally.  We grant Kuiper’s request to operate in these bands outside of the United States since its proposed use is consistent with the international allocations and will be used to communicate with non-U.S.-based earth stations. See Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 21 (requesting a waiver of the U.S. Table, to the extent necessary, to operate in this band).  Since Kuiper’s proposed operations are consistent with the U.S. Table, there is no need to address this request.\n",

Iridium states that the Commission should deny Kuiper’s request to operate NGSO MSS feeder links associated with MSS operations in the 19.7-20 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands or, alternatively, condition any authorization to ensure that Iridium’s network is protected and Kuiper actually uses the spectrum to support MSS operations. Iridium Reply at 2.  If Kuiper’s request is granted, Iridium argues for the following conditions: limiting operations in the 19.4-19.6 GHz, 29.1-29.25 GHz, and 29.25-29.5 GHz bands to communications between feeder-link earth stations and user terminals licensed by the Commission in the MSS; operating in NGSO MSS feeder-link bands on a secondary basis at most; and on successfully coordinating with Iridium.  Id. at 8-9.\n",

      "  Iridium argues that the grant of O3b waivers for these frequencies was a very different situation because (1) O3b received its waiver before the “Commission proposed service rules permitting NGSO ESIMs as an application of FSS,” and thus a waiver was needed; Iridium Reply at 5.\n",
      " and (2) the size of Kuiper’s system raises significant issues for new NGSO entrants and applications for entry. Iridium at 6-7.  In response to Iridium’s arguments about the size of its constellation, Kuiper asserts that the number of satellites in the Kuiper system makes co-existence easier to accomplish.  Kuiper Opposition at 32.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. We are not persuaded that Kuiper’s request for MSS operations is very different than O3b’s market access for MSS and MSS feeder links in these bands.  Similar to O3b, Kuiper requests authority for both FSS and MSS in certain bands.  Although there is a size difference between Kuiper’s system and O3b’s, we also evaluate each application or market access request separately based on its own specific circumstances in our public interest analysis.  We find that it is in the public interest to grant Kuiper’s request to provide MSS, in addition to FSS, in the 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands subject to certain conditions discussed herein.  \n",
      "22. These bands are allocated internationally to the FSS and MSS. 47 CFR § 2.106.\n",
      "  The Commission has also adopted these frequency allocations, but has not established service rules for MSS operations in the 19.7- 20.2 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands. 47 CFR § 25.217.  Historically, FSS and MSS provided different services using distinct frequency bands.  Over the last 10 years, however, the Commission has allowed mobile applications within FSS, such as earth stations on vessels (ESV), vehicle-mounted earth stations (VMES), and earth-stations aboard aircraft (ESAA).  These earth stations operate within the FSS but they all transmit and receive while in motion.  Generally, the primary difference between the mobile applications operating in the FSS and MSS concerned the type of antenna in use (directional for the services operating within the FSS, or omni-directional services operating with the MSS).  In MSS only bands, frequencies were typically assigned to a single operator because omni-directional antennas could not discriminate between satellites.  In the FSS bands, since the antennas were directional and used by multiple operators, satellites have been assigned to the same frequencies because the antennas could discriminate among the different satellites.  Kuiper’s operations will include mobile operations, and its terminals will use directional antennas as described above for mobile applications operating in the FSS, which are better equipped to share spectrum compared to those for MSS only frequencies.  The definition of MSS does not specify the type of antennas used for communications with space stations.  See 47 CFR § 25.103.\n",
      "  Although EPFD limits do not apply to NGSO MSS systems, we condition Kuiper’s operations in the 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands on complying with the applicable EPFD limits for FSS operations, even when these operations are conducted within the MSS.  This is justified because, as stated by Kuiper, these MSS operations have the same characteristics as its FSS operations. Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 23-24.\n",
      "  This condition is also consistent with the default requirement adopted in the NGSO FSS Order that NGSO systems protect GSO networks. See 47 CFR § 25.289; NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7809.\n",
      "  In addition, we remind Kuiper that its MSS operations cannot claim protection from current or future GSO FSS networks.\n",
      "23. We note that there is no sharing criteria between NGSO FSS and NGSO MSS systems in the 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands.  Kuiper states that its MSS operations will have the same characteristics of the previously described FSS operations and that directional earth station antennas will also be used for these operations. Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 23-24.\n",
      "  Therefore, Kuiper’s NGSO MSS operations would not be distinguishable from NGSO FSS operations in the 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30.0 GHz bands being conducted with ESIMs.  Although Iridium argues that we should deny Kuiper’s operations as inconsistent with the Ka-band plan, given the existing MSS allocations and the fact that Kuiper’s proposed NGSO MSS operations have the same characteristics as those in an NGSO FSS system—a designated usage under the Ka-band plan—we find it in the public interest to grant Kuiper authority to operate as an NGSO MSS system with conditions in this band and waive the Ka-band plan to the extent necessary.  This action ensures the most efficient and effective sharing of spectrum while providing Kuiper the regulatory flexibility it seeks to provide both FSS and MSS.\n",
      "24. The 19.4-19.6 GHz and 29.1-29.5 GHz MSS Feeder Link Bands.  Kuiper requests authority to operate in the 19.4-19.6 GHz band and 29.1-29.5 GHz band for the provision of MSS feeder links to its NGSO space stations.  Under the Ka-band plan, use of the 19.4-19.6 GHz and 29.1-29.5 GHz bands by NGSO systems is limited to feeder links for non-geostationary-satellite systems in the MSS.

      "26. EPFD Analysis.  We find that the EPFD analysis provided in Kuiper’s application and associated filings is sufficient to justify authorization in many of Kuiper’s proposed frequency bands as conditioned.  As noted in the section on FSS operations in the Ka-band, and as we have done in connection with other NGSO FSS systems, we condition this authorization on Kuiper receiving a favorable or “qualified favorable” rating of its EPFD demonstration by the ITU prior to initiation of service.  Additionally, Kuiper must communicate the ITU finding to the Commission and, in case of an unfavorable finding, adjust its operation to satisfy the ITU requirements.  We note, however, that several commenters expressed concern that, even if Kuiper complies with the Commission’s rules, it could still cause unacceptable interference to GSO networks because it has submitted multiple ITU filings for its system, which means that the ITU will issue an analysis based on each filing rather than Kuiper’s entire system.

      "  As we noted in an earlier order, however, there is no legal requirement that third parties evaluate the sufficiency of EPFD data inputs prior to the deployment of an NGSO system, and we believe that such a requirement would unfairly prejudice Kuiper’s timely implementation of its new system.

The GSO Operators further argue that the Commission must take steps to ensure that applicable aggregate EPFD limits are met by all operating Ka-band NGSO systems and request that we require that 60 days prior to launch Kuiper must have completed coordination with other NGSO operators to ensure compliance with aggregate EPFD limits. GSO Operators at 3-4.\n",
      "  We do not adopt this requirement recommended by the GSO Operators, but instead require that as a condition of authorization, Kuiper must comply with ITU Resolution 76, which makes all NGSO FSS systems, operating in a frequency band where protection of GSO FSS systems is required, jointly responsible for keeping aggregate EPFD levels within limits specified in the same Resolution.

      "32. Because the design of Kuiper’s satellites is not completed, and because Kuiper consequently did not present specific information concerning some required elements of a debris mitigation plan, we condition our grant of the Kuiper application on Kuiper presenting, and the Commission granting, a modification of this authorization to provide for review of the final orbital debris mitigation plan. The Commission and the International Bureau have previously required applicants to file a modification application including updated orbital debris mitigation information in some instances.  See SpaceX Order, at 33 FCC Rcd. 3391, 3398, para. 15 (2018 LeoSat MA Inc., Order and Declaratory Ruling, 33 FCC Rcd 11486, 11491, para. 12 (2018); Viasat, Inc.

As indicated in the recently revised U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP), at p. 7, 5-1 and p. 5, 4-1.a., large constellations should target high post-mission disposal reliability, taking into consideration factors such as mass, collision probability, orbital location and other relevant parameters, and should limit cumulative re-entry casualty risk from the constellation, preferably through direct re-entry, design for demise, or targeted re-entry away from land masses.\n",
      "  Additionally, consistent with conditions placed on other NGSO FSS systems, Kuiper must coordinate its physical operations with space stations of NGSO systems operating at similar orbital altitudes. See e.g., SpaceX Order at 3398, para. 15 and ViaSat Order paras. 31, 52c.\n",

See n. 1, supra.\n",
      "  For licensing and grants of U.S. market access for NGSO-like systems, the Commission employs a processing round procedure which includes a public notice announcing a cut-off date for applications to be considered concurrently. 47 CFR §§ 25.156 and 25.157.\n",
      "  Kuiper requests waivers of Commission rules that set the deadlines and procedures for consideration of applications in processing rounds. 47 CFR § 25.155(b) (“A license application for NGSO-like satellite operation . . . will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more mutually exclusive applications only if the application is received by the Commission in a condition acceptable for filing by the “cut-off’ date specified in a public notice.”); 47 CFR § 25.157(c).\n",
      "  Kuiper states that granting its requests for waiver of sections 25.155(b) and 25.157(c) of the Commission’s rules “would not undermine the purpose of the rule because adoption of the Section 25.261 spectrum sharing framework by the Commission in its NGSO FSS Order moots the need for comparative review to ensure competitive entry.” See Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 17.\n",

As discussed below we find that Kuiper’s premise that our processing round rules are mooted by the adoption of section 25.261 spectrum sharing rules is erroneous and Kuiper has not shown otherwise that a grant of its waiver request of sections 25.155(b) and 25.157(c) of the Commission’s processing round rules would serve the public interest in this particular case.  Accordingly, Kuiper will be included in the March 2020 Processing Round.  We also find an insufficient basis to treat Kuiper on an equal basis with earlier authorized systems under section 25.261 of the Commission rules, and find that Kuiper must coordinate to prevent harmful interference to operational systems licensed or granted U.S. market access in the previous NGSO FSS processing rounds.  We expect that, regardless of the sharing status of systems in different processing rounds, systems authorized in an earlier processing round may not withhold information necessary to effectuate good faith coordination to enable Kuiper to start operations.\n",
      "35. NGSO Processing Round Waiver Request.  In 2003, the Commission adopted a modified processing round procedure for NGSO-like satellite systems providing that applications for NGSO-like satellite systems be treated as either a “competing application,” i.e., filed in response to a public notice initiating a processing round, or a “lead application,” i.e. all other applications for NGSO-like satellite operation. 47 CFR § 25.157(c).  Amendment of the Commission’s Space Station Licensing Rules and Policies, First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 18 FCC Rcd 12674, Appendix B, 10896 (2003) (2003 Space Station Licensing Reform Order).\n",

Specifically, an “Avoidance of In-Line Interference Events” approach was adopted under which all qualified applicants would share the available spectrum except when earth stations and space stations of different systems move into an alignment that creates an in-line interference event.  The spectrum would be split for the duration of the in-line event.

NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7825, para. 48.\n",

      "  Kuiper argues that in this case-by-case analysis should conclude that the ability of Kuiper’s system to satisfy section 25.261 spectrum sharing requirements obviates the need for its participation in a processing round. Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 10-16, citing 47 CFR § 25.261.  Kuiper also argues that a waiver of the processing round is justified by the significant public interest benefit it believes its system will provide and that a waiver does not undercut the policies behind the requirement of a processing round.  Kuiper Opposition at 5-6.\n",

      "37. Kuiper states that the NGSO processing round framework the Commission created in 2003 was based on satellite systems that communicated with earth stations that had minimal or non-existent directivity towards a satellite.  This lack of directivity generally prevented NGSO systems from operating in the same spectrum without causing harmful interference to each other. Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 18.\n",
      "  Kuiper contends that since its system will use directional antennas this “essentially moots the need for comparative consideration of multiple applications in a processing round” because grant of its application would not foreclose grant of future applications that chose to use the same spectrum. Id. at 19.\n",
      "  Kuiper also states that processing round and spectrum sharing rules operate independently of each other, such that a processing round is still necessary for systems that lack the ability to share spectrum, but that participation in a processing round is not a prerequisite to “sharing spectrum with authorized and previously-filed systems.” Id. at 5-6. \n",
      "  Thus, Kuiper states, “the question before the Commission in considering waiver of the processing round rules is whether the Kuiper system would preclude entry of future entrants” Id. at 8.\n",
      " “and [can] coexist with other authorized systems.” Letter from Mariah Dodson Shuman, Corporate Counsel, Kuiper Systems, LLC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, IBFS File No. SAT-LOA-20190704-00057, at 21-22 (filed Jan. 27, 2020) (Kuiper Jan. 27 Ex Parte).\n",
      "  Kuiper contends that its system will not preclude future entry and can coexist with authorized systems, and that section 25.261 applies to “all qualifying NGSO FSS systems regardless of when their applications are received.” Id. at 20.

      "38. Kuiper asserts that its analysis shows that operation of its system will lead to a more favorable interference environment because Boeing and LeoSat, both of which filed in connection with the processing rounds initiated in July 2016 and May 2017, will not operate their proposed systems.  Kuiper contends that the design of those two systems would have created a “large number of long-duration in-line events with other NGSO FSS systems.” See Kuiper Opposition at 20.\n",
      "  Kuiper states that the “previously anticipated operating environment [that included Boeing and LeoSat] and the currently proposed operating environment [without Boeing and LeoSat, but with Kuiper] shows no material impact on in-line events,” Id. at 20-21.\n",
      " and that even when no operator seeks to avoid in-line events operators are better off with Kuiper, but without Boeing and LeoSat, due to the challenges that the latter two constellations posed for other operators. Id. at 22.\n",
      "  Thus, Kuiper argues that, if its system would have no impact on the operations of existing systems, then its system should be on par with previous round authorizations with regard to coordination negotiations.  This, according to Kuiper, is consistent with the “case-by-case approach” adopted in the NGSO FSS Order and protects the investment expectations of the systems authorized in previous processing rounds. See Kuiper Opposition at 6 (stating that “Amazon’s request for waiver of the processing round rule in Section 25.157(c) is grounded in the technical features of the Kuiper System” and “[g]rant of the requested waiver will neither prejudice existing NGSO FSS applications, nor preclude competitive entry by future systems using the same spectrum.”).\n",

Iridium, WorldVu, and SES object to Kuiper’s interpretation of the NGSO spectrum sharing rule and argue that Kuiper seeks to be treated as if it had participated in previous processing rounds, effectively rendering the processing round cut-off date meaningless. See Iridium at 1 (stating “[p]rocessing the Kuiper application as if Amazon had applied three years ago would burden Iridium unnecessarily, and would place existing NGSO FSS licensees at an unfair disadvantage.  It also would eliminate any incentive for future applicants to comply with a cut-off date established by the Commission.”); WorldVu Reply at 3 (stating that “[g]iven that the Kuiper Application was filed nearly three years after the First Round cut-off date, Kuiper is presumptively not entitled to share spectrum on an equal basis with First Round participants.”); and SES Petition at 6 (stating that “[t]hus, under the terms of the NGSO Order, the 6% ΔT/T sharing criterion codified in Section 25.261 applies only among the parties who timely filed applications by the November 2016 processing round cut-off deadline.”).\n",

      "  WorldVu contends that to authorize Kuiper outside of a processing round and give it equal status regarding spectrum sharing would create “perpetual regulatory uncertainty for current NGSO operators” and affect “long-term capital deployment plans” that must account for an “endless cycle of new entrants seeking to encroach on critical NGSO spectrum resources.” WorldVu at 11.\n",

      "41. We find that Kuiper has failed to provide sufficient justification to waive our processing round rules.  Kuiper asserts that the size, scope, and location of Kuiper’s planned investment, and the type of services proposed Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 1-2.\n",
      " constitute a “compelling public interest [benefit]” Kuiper Jan. 27 Ex Parte at 21 \n",

      "  Kuiper provides, however, no evidence that there is a need for a deviation from our processing round here.  \n",
      "42. Kuiper’s waiver request relies on its premise that “adoption of the Section 25.261 spectrum sharing framework by the Commission in its NGSO FSS Order moots the need” for our processing round rules. To the extent Kuiper contends that the section 25.261 spectrum sharing framework adopted in the NGSO FSS Order obviates the need for processing rounds, we reject this view.  See Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 18.  We agree with SES that had “the Commission intended for Section 25.261 to replace the processing round framework for NGSO applications, it would not have explicitly emphasized that only ‘qualified applicants in a processing round’ are entitled to rely on the 6% ΔT/T sharing framework, with future NGSO filings considered on a ‘case-by-case’ basis.”  SES Petition at 6 (quoting NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd 7809 at 7829, para. 61).  Moreover, as Telesat notes, if Kuiper’s contention was correct, then the Commission in the NGSO FSS Order “would have eliminated Section 25.157(c), which establishes the processing round requirement for NGSO applications, or at least limited the applicability of Section 25.157(c) to NGSO systems that do not propose the use of directional antennas.  Instead, the Commission left Section 25.157(c) untouched.”  Telesat Reply at 4.\n",
      "  While the Commission in adopting this rule in the NGSO FSS Order recognized that multiple NGSO FSS systems can share spectrum, it reiterated the importance of processing rounds “to provide a measure of certainty in lieu of adopting an open-ended requirement to accommodate all future applicants.” NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7829, para. 61.  \n",
      "  The practical effect of adopting Kuiper’s position would be to create an open-ended processing round in which new entrants would be placed on par with previously authorized systems and therefore fail to provide certainty to these systems as intended when establishing a processing round.  This is contrary to the public interest goals of our processing round rules. See NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7829, para. 61. (stating that “[t]he purpose of the recent processing rounds was to establish a sharing environment among NGSO systems, to provide a measure of certainty in lieu of adopting an open-ended requirement to accommodate all future applicants.”).\n",
      "  As in the present case, where multiple operators plan to share scarce spectrum resources, an open processing round approach would result in deteriorating investment environment resulting from uncertainty regarding spectrum availability.  \n",
      "43. There is nothing in the record for us to conclude that in the absence of a waiver, Kuiper faces any undue hardship, that Kuiper has been subjected to unfair processes, or that without this waiver Kuiper cannot provide the range of services it proposes.  In fact, it appears Kuiper would be able to provide quality broadband service as a system authorized in a later processing round. SpaceX Reply at 19.\n",
      "  In light of the deficient showing here, we find that deviating from the policies behind our processing round rules would not serve the public interest.  In view of all these points, we deny Kuiper’s request for waivers of the processing round rules and find that treating Kuiper as part of the March 2020 NGSO Processing Round will serve the public interest.  \n",
      "44. As Kuiper notes, there are prior instances in which the International Bureau waived certain processing round rules. See Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 19-20.\n",
      "  Although these Bureau-level decisions are not binding on the Commission, See Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 526 F.3d 763, 769 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n",
      " on alternative and independent grounds, we note that none of this Bureau-level precedent cited by Kuiper is on point to support the requested waiver of processing round rules.  Kuiper argues that “not to initiate a processing round in response to the filing of Amazon’s Kuiper System application would also be entirely consistent with FCC precedent.” Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 19.\n",
      "  Kuiper notes that what is material about these prior waivers is that they “stand for the simple proposition” that the Bureau will waive a processing round if it determines that a proposed system would not preclude entry of future entrants and can “coexist with other authorized systems,” Kuiper Jan. 27 Ex Parte at 21-22.\n",
      " and that the promise of Kuiper’s system and the substantial financial investment underway would be stifled if the Commission awarded the entire band to those who simply filed paperwork first. Id. at 22-23.\n",

      " or reflected a situation where a waiver was granted after the Commission concluded that a system’s ability to comply with the NGSO FSS sharing rules obviated the need for a processing round. For example, Northrop Grumman was the only remaining applicant from the 1997 processing round, the design of its system allowed for additional entrants, and its application was processed as if it had been filed on a first-come, first-served basis.  The operating altitude for Northrop’s system also reduced potential in-line interference, and if such interference occurred the system could switch to GSO satellite to avoid interference.  In DigitalGlobe and Space Imaging, the Bureau waived the processing round requirement because both system applications could be considered under the first-come, first-served procedure because the Bureau determined that authorizing an Earth Exploration Satellite Service (EESS) licensee to operate in a particular frequency band does not preclude other EESS licensees from operating in that band and did not cause harmful interference to currently operating EESS systems using those frequencies.\n",
      "  Our criteria for waiving a processing round is not as unequivocal as Kuiper represents.  A later-flied applicant may be able to share with authorized systems and thus not preclude future entry, but that does not mean that investment expectations of prior authorized systems cannot be adversely affected or that the efficient administration of spectrum cannot be compromised by any future entrant.  We believe it is important that we maintain the flexibility to evaluate the particulars in deciding whether to waive a processing round rather than restrict ourselves via a one-size-fits-all approach.  Further, we do not grant processing round waivers routinely, rather we evaluate each waiver request on a case-by-case basis and determine whether, based on our review of the record in each case, deviating from the policies behind our processing round rules would serve the public interest.  The practical effect of adopting Kuiper’s position as a general rule would be to create an indefinitely open processing round in which new entrants would be placed on par with previously authorized systems and therefore fail to provide certainty to these systems as intended when establishing a processing round undermining the public interest benefits these rules aim to serve. See NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7829, para. 61.\n",
      "  Here, Kuiper failed to show that a waiver is warranted and deviating from the policies behind our processing round rules would serve the public interest.\n",
      "45. Additionally, we disagree with SES that Kuiper’s request for a waiver of the processing round rules requires dismissal of Kuiper’s application. See SES Reply at 3, 14-15 (stating that “[b]ecause the Commission must deny Kuiper’s attempt to circumvent the processing round rules, it must also dismiss the Application, as its public interest showing assumes that Kuiper would not be required to protect previously authorized Ka-band NGSO systems.  Nothing in the Application or the Opposition provides evidence that Kuiper could fulfill its business plan if its request to evade the processing round framework is rejected.”).\n",
      "  We find that the record in this proceeding is complete and contains sufficient information for us to evaluate Kuiper’s application under our rules.  The conditions we place on Kuiper’s authorization will ensure that previously authorized Ka-band NGSO systems are protected.  \n",
      "46. Section 25.261 Default Spectrum Sharing Framework.  In light of our decision to deny Kuiper’s waiver request of our processing round rules and include Kuiper in the March 2020 Processing Round, we discuss below application of section 25.261 spectrum sharing framework to Kuiper.  Section 25.261(c) of the Commission’s rules states the procedure by which, absent coordination, NGSO FSS operators can resolve interference issues. 47 CFR § 25.261(c).\n",
      "  The Commission stated that it would “initially limit sharing under [25.261] to qualified applicants in a processing round.” NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7829, para. 61.\n",
      "  Applicants or market access petitioners within the same processing round have equal status during coordination negotiations.  With respect to applications or market access requests that might be filed outside of a processing round and whether such later-filed applications or market access requests would have equal negotiating status to previously authorized systems, the Commission stated such systems “must necessarily be examined on a case-by-case basis based on”:  (1) “the situation at the time”; (2) “the need to protect existing expectations and investments”; (3) the need to “provide for additional entry”; and (4) “any comments filed by incumbent operators and reasoning presented by the new applicant.” Id. at 7829, para. 61.  Contrary to Kuiper’s suggestion, see Kuiper Opposition at 6, 9, the Commission did not state nor infer that a later-filed application that proposes a system that uses directional antennas and can meet the default sharing requirement is automatically on equal footing with earlier authorized systems.  See NGSO FSS Order. at 7825, para. 50 (“our default sharing solution sets all applicants in a processing round on an equal basis”) (emphasis added).\n",
      "  Within this framework, we conclude that Kuiper has not made a sufficient showing that its application warrants being treated on an equal basis with earlier authorized systems, independent of participation in the appropriate processing round.  \n",
      "47. First, when we examine the “situation at the time” and protecting investment expectations, we note that the Commission has authorized the operation of numerous Ka-band NGSO FSS systems in the two previous Ka-band NGSO FSS processing rounds. See, e.g., Viasat, Inc. Petition for Declaratory Ruling Granting Access for a Non-U.S. Licensed Non-Geostationary Orbit Satellite Network, Order and Declaratory Ruling, 35 FCC Rcd 4324 (2020); O3b Limited, Request for Modification of U.S. Market Access for O3b Limited’s Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit System in the Fixed-Satellite Service and in the Mobile-Satellite Service, Order and Declaratory Ruling, 33 FCC Rcd 5508 (2018); Space Exploration Holdings, LLC, Application for Approval for Orbital Deployment and Operating Authority for the SpaceX NGSO Satellite System, Memorandum Opinion, Order and Authorization, 33 FCC Rcd 3391 (2018) (SpaceX Order); Telesat Petition for Declaratory Ruling to Grant Access to the U.S. Market for Telesat’s NGSO Constellation, Order and Declaratory Ruling, 32 FCC Rcd 9663 (2017); WorldVu Satellites Limited, Petition for Declaratory Ruling Granting Access to the U.S. Market for the OneWeb NGSO FSS System, Order and Declaratory Ruling, 32 FCC Rcd 5366 (2017).\n",
      "  Not all the authorized systems are at the same level of progress, but some have made substantial progress and, presumably, all are configuring their systems relying on an interference environment based upon the approved systems.  This is not a situation where, for example, the Commission had authorized one or two systems and those systems had made minimal progress toward operation.  \n",
      "48. Second, when we consider the question of providing additional entry and consider comments from incumbents and Kuiper, we also find an insufficient basis to treat Kuiper on an equal basis with earlier authorized systems.  Commenters argue treating Kuiper on an equal footing here would create uncertainty, thus undermining “existing expectations and investments” for systems filed in previous processing rounds. See, e.g., WorldVu at 11; Theia Reply at 2. \n",
      "  Kuiper filed its application three years after the first Ka-band NGSO FSS processing round and did not demonstrate or attempt to demonstrate that it would be unable to offer services if not treated on par with systems authorized in the previous processing rounds.  In response to Kuiper’s analysis of how an interference environment without Boeing and LeoSat would enable accommodation of Kuiper’s system, commenters rightfully ask how much of the benefit from the absence of Boeing and LeoSat should go to Kuiper rather than to operators of previous processing rounds. See, e.g., Theia notes that the Commission’s rules do not contemplate that a later-filed applicant such as Kuiper can step into the place of systems that exit, and Kuiper’s analysis does not account for the “environment-wide effects” of Kuiper’s system.  Theia Reply at 5.  SES argues that it is not reasonable for Kuiper to perform an interference analysis that includes all the authorized systems because no one “reasonably expected” that all systems would deploy, and that given the amendments by SpaceX and OneWeb it is unrealistic to believe that no additional systems would enter.  SES Reply at 13.  SpaceX questions Kuiper’s “reasonable expectations” claim by arguing that no applicants expected the type of interference environment Kuiper describes because no one expected all systems to deploy.  SpaceX Reply at 5-6.  SES further argues that without considering future entry, Kuiper cannot provide a realistic analysis of the interference environment for any future scenario.  SES Reply at 14.  SpaceX disagrees that Kuiper’s 3,236 satellite system “could effectively squeeze into the space left by Boeing and LeoSat [who would have used the same spectrum sharing capabilities as Kuiper] without effect on the first-round interference baseline [and without increasing the number of in-line events].”  SpaceX Reply at 8-9.\n",
      "  \n",
      "49. In the NGSO FSS Order, we stated our intent to set all NGSO FSS applicants and market access petitioners in a processing round on equal footing; that we believe coordination among NGSO FSS operators provides the best opportunity for efficient spectrum sharing; and that the Commission might intervene if the coordination discussions were not being conducted in good faith. NGSO FSS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 7825, para. 48.\n",
      "  We also stated that we expected operators to negotiate in good faith with an aim to accommodating later-filed applicants. Id at 7825, 7829, paras. 48, 61.\n",
      "  Our expectation is that regardless of the sharing status of systems in different processing rounds, systems authorized in an earlier processing round may not withhold information necessary to effectuate good faith coordination to enable Kuiper to start operations.  This would allow the most efficient and effective sharing of the spectrum and enable additional entry into the marketplace, consistent with our rules and policies.  \n",
      "50. We fully anticipate that all parties will negotiate in good faith, and Kuiper will be able to reach a coordination agreement with operators authorized in previous processing rounds.  In the event this does not happen, Kuiper must make a showing demonstrating to the Commission that its operations will not cause harmful interference to any operational system licensed or granted U.S. market access in the July 2016 Processing Round and the May 2017 Processing Round.  To commence operations in these bands, the Commission must approve Kuiper’s demonstration as sufficient to show that Kuiper’s NGSO system can operate without causing harmful interference to any operational systems in these processing rounds.\n",

Moreover, the March 2020 Processing Round did not preclude other applicants from proposing the use of these bands for MSS feeder links.  We believe that the more efficient and effective approach in this instance is to impose conditions on Kuiper’s operation, requiring coordination with existing operators that have MSS feeder links in the bands requested by Kuiper to ensure protection of such systems.

Kuiper Application, Legal Narrative at 29.\n",
      "  In view of these limitations to fill in Schedule S and the fact that Kuiper has explained its system’s parameters for these fields, we find that the requested relief would not undermine the policy objective of the rules in question and strict compliance with certain aspects of the Schedule S form would be inconsistent with the public interest.

      "57. Radio Astronomy.  The transmission of out-of-band signals into allocated radio astronomy bands can cause interference to radio astronomy observations, especially for transmissions pointed directly to the radio astronomy site from satellites.  While Kuiper does not intend to transmit in bands allocated for radio astronomy or immediately adjacent bands, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) notes that Kuiper should be made aware that radio astronomy as a service frequently makes use of observations (passive) in bands not allocated to the radio astronomy service, including 17.7-18.6 GHz and 18.8-20.2 GHz.  NTIA states that this practice is a result of scientifically valuable signals being subject, for example, to the Doppler Effect and shifted in frequency outside radio astronomy-allocated bands.

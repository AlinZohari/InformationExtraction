Operating 2320 satellites in 58 orbital planes in total at altitudes of 500, 600, 700 and 800 kilometers. At an altitude of 500 km, there are 15 orbital planes, each hosting 36 satellites, resulting in a total of 540 satellites at an inclination of 36.5 degrees. For the 600 km altitude, 23 orbital planes are present, with each plane containing 50 satellites, summing up to 1150 satellites at an inclination of 49 degrees. At the 700 km mark, 15 orbital planes are equipped with 27 satellites each, leading to a total of 405 satellites at a 51.9-degree inclination. Lastly, at 800 km, there are 5 orbital planes, and each has 45 satellites, amounting to a total of 225 satellites at an inclination of 59.3 degrees. The constellation are require to launch and operate 50 percent of its satellites no later than July 30, 2000, and must launch the remaining space stations necessary to complete its authorized service constellation, place them in their assigned orbits, and operate each of them in accordance with the authorization no later than July 30, 2020. This satelllites will have an operational lifetime of five years orbitting in its designated plane.",

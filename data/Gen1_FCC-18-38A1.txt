I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Memorandum Opinion, Order and Authorization, we authorize Space Exploration 
Holdings, LLC (SpaceX) to construct, deploy, and operate a proposed non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) 
satellite system comprising 4,425 satellites for the provision of fixed-satellite service (FSS) around the 
world.

 Space Exploration Holdings, LLC, Application for Approval for Orbital Deployment and Operating Authority for 
the SpaceX NGSO Satellite System, IBFS File No. SAT-LOA-20161115-00118 (filed Nov. 15, 2016) (SpaceX 
Application).  On November 22, 2016, SpaceX submitted an erratum to its application that contains a corrected 
version of the Technical Attachment, in which the scale of the axes in the antenna beam contour diagrams (Figures 
A.3.1-3 through A.3.1-8 and A.3.2-1 through A.3.2-5) reflects the written description, and a corrected version of the 
associated GXT files to update those in the original Schedule S.  See Letter from William M. Wiltshire, Counsel to 
SpaceX, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, (Nov. 22, 2016) (SpaceX Erratum).  As described below, SpaceX 
subsequently filed a second application seeking to add certain frequency bands to its system.  Space Exploration 
Holdings, LLC, Application for Approval for Orbital Deployment and Operating Authority for the SpaceX NGSO 
Satellite System Supplement, IBFS File No. SAT?LOA?20170726?00110 (filed Jul.. 26, 2017) (SpaceX 
Supplemental Application).  SpaceX’s request in the Supplemental Application for operations in the 29.3-29.5 GHz 
frequency bands is not before us, because the International Bureau has not accepted that part of the application for 
filing.  See Satellite Policy Branch Information:  Space Station Applications Accepted for Filing, Public Notice, 
Report No. SAT-01277 (IB Oct. 20, 2017).  The International Bureau deferred a determination concerning the 
acceptability for filing for the 29.3-29.5 GHz band because the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio 
Regulations limit the use of the band 29.1-29.5 GHz by the FSS to geostationary-satellite systems and feeder links to 
NGSO systems in the mobile-satellite service.  See 5.535A of the ITU Radio Regulations.

II. BACKGROUND
2. Application.  On November 15, 2016, SpaceX filed an application requesting authority for its 
proposed NGSO FSS satellite system, comprising 4,425 satellites in 83 orbital planes, at an approximate 
altitude of 1,110 to 1,325 kilometers.  In this application, SpaceX proposes to operate in the 10.7-12.7 
GHz, 13.85-14.5 GHz, 17.8-18.6 GHz, 18.8-19.3 GHz, 27.5-29.1 GHz, and 29.5-30 GHz bands.  SpaceX 
also requests waivers of certain Commission rules.
3
3. Processing Rounds.  On July 15, 2016, the Commission accepted for filing the petition for 
declaratory ruling of WorldVu Satellites Limited, d/b/a/ OneWeb (OneWeb Petition).
4
  At the same time 
that the Commission accepted the OneWeb Petition for filing, it initiated a processing round for additional 
NGSO-like applications and petitions in the frequency bands requested by OneWeb.
5
  The processing 
round closed on November 15, 2016.  Eleven additional applications and petitions were filed for NGSO-
like satellite systems, including the application filed by SpaceX.
6
  On May 26, 2017, the SpaceX 
Application was accepted for filing, and at the same time a second processing round was initiated for the 
additional frequency bands requested by other applicants and petitioners.
7
  The second processing round 
closed on July 26, 2017 with two additional applications received, including a supplemental application 
from SpaceX, which requested the addition of the 12.75-13.25 GHz, 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.3-29.5 GHz 
bands.
8
  In that application, SpaceX also requested certain waivers of the Commission rules.

 In the SpaceX Supplemental Application, SpaceX requests waiver of sections 25.157(e), 25.164(b), 25.145(c), 
25.146(i), and, to the extent necessary, restrictions on SpaceX’s proposed use of the 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.3-29.5 
GHz bands for NGSO operations in the U.S. and various limitations in the Commission’s Schedule S.

3
applicants and petitioners filing in this processing round, including OneWeb, proposes an NGSO FSS 
system that, if approved, would have the same status and the same rights as other participants in the same 
processing round in case any division of frequencies is required to avoid mutual interference.
10
  On June 
22, 2017, the Commission adopted an order granting the OneWeb Petition (OneWeb Order).
11
  On 
November 2, 2017, the Commission adopted orders granting petitions for U.S. market access by Space 
Norway and Telesat.
12
4. Comments.  Telesat Canada (Telesat) and ViaSat, Inc. (ViaSat) filed petitions to deny the 
SpaceX Application.  Telesat’s petition is based mainly on concerns related to the impact of the 
“avoidance of in-line interference” mechanism.
13
  ViaSat echoes concerns about the in-line interference 
mechanism, and in its petition urges the Commission to deny SpaceX’s application unless certain 
conditions are imposed on the grant.
14
  Other satellite operators filed comments expressing concerns 
regarding SpaceX’s orbital debris showing.
15
  SES S.A. (SES) and O3b Limited (O3b) stated that SpaceX 
has not included files with equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) and power flux density (PFD) 
masks necessary to independently assess the proposed system’s compliance with applicable equivalent 
power flux-density (EPFD limits) and that the Commission should defer action on this proposal pending 
submission of the relevant PFD and EIRP mask data.
16
  SpaceX opposed the petitions to deny and

Canada, Order and Declaratory Ruling, 32 FCC Rcd 9663(2017) (Telesat Canada Order).
13
 Telesat argues that SpaceX’s NGSO system would interfere with Telesat’s NGSO operations because the two 
systems would operate in overlapping geographical areas on overlapping Ka-band frequencies, and that Telesat has 
demonstrated that in-line interference mechanisms are unworkable.  Furthermore, Telesat states that SpaceX offers 
no recognition that the Canadian ITU filings that are associated with Telesat’s NGSO system have date priority over 
later ITU filings that may be associated with SpaceX’s system band frequencies.  Telesat also indicates that grant of 
SpaceX’s application must be conditioned on the outcome of the NGSO rulemaking, as the Commission did in 
granting OneWeb’s NGSO application.  Telesat Petition to Deny at 1-5 (filed June 26, 2017).  ViaSat argues that 
reliance on the “avoidance of in-line interference” mechanism in awarding spectrum would actually harm the ability 
of competitive NGSO systems to operate effectively.  ViaSat Petition to Deny or Impose Conditions at 75-79 (filed 
June 26, 2017) (ViaSat Petition to Deny).  ViaSat also argues that SpaceX’s (and others’) requests for waiver of the 
current and longstanding band segmentation provisions set forth in section 25.157 of the Commission’s rules 
constitute improper and inequitable post-cutoff notice rule changes.  ViaSat also cites the potential for aggregate 
interference from multiple NGSO systems into GSO operations.  Id. at 8.
14
 See ViaSat Petition to Deny (requesting that Commission condition grant on compliance with the outcome of 
future rulemakings, limit operations to the parameters specified in the application rather than the limits of what the 
rules permit, and impose several conditions related to aggregate interference); ViaSat Reply (filed July 14, 2017).

further information from SpaceX regarding its plans to mitigate orbital collisions and debris.  WorldVu Satellite 
Limited Comments at 7-15 (filed June 26, 2017) (OneWeb Comments).  SES and O3b requested SpaceX to provide 
further technical information regarding orbital debris and EPFD compliance.  SES and O3b Comments at 4-7 (filed 
June 26, 2017).  Spire made a similar request.  Spire Comments to SpaceX at 3 (filed June 26, 2017) (Spire

responded to the comments.
17
  A number of commenters urge the Commission to hold off acting on the 
request for partial waiver of the final implementation milestone in Section 25.164(b).
18
  SpaceX also 
responded to these comments.
19
  Finally, EchoStar and Hughes filed reply comments in which they 
argued that SpaceX’s request for waiver of the downlink PFD limits in the 18.8-19.3 GHz band should be 
denied because it increases the risk of interference to space-to-Earth links that Hughes is authorized to 
use in the United States, and that grant of this waiver request would change the conditions established by 
section 25.208(e), upon which Hughes based its decision to operate on a non-interference basis.
20
5. Comments to SpaceX Supplemental Application.  OneWeb and SES/O3b filed comments to 
the SpaceX Supplemental Application.  Similar to its earlier comments, OneWeb argues that the SpaceX 
FSS constellation would not be able to meet the Commission’s milestone and domestic coverage 
requirements, and thus SpaceX’s request for waiver of these requirements should be denied.
21
  OneWeb 
also argues that SpaceX had not demonstrated that its system will not increase the risk of collision with 
other operators or casualty risks upon deorbit, and that grant of SpaceX’s application should be delayed 
until it provides quantitative data concerning these risks.
22
  SES argues that the Commission must 
condition SpaceX’s authorization in the 19.7-20.2 GHz band to not interfere with SES’s operations as 
well as other geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) systems.  It further argues that SpaceX’s request for 
waiver of the implementation milestones should be deferred pending the outcome of the NGSO 
proceedings, and that SpaceX’s authorization should include terms and conditions similar to those applied 
to O3b and other systems.
23
  SpaceX filed a response to these comments.
24
  We address the petitions and 
comments on both the Application and the Supplemental Application, as well as SpaceX’s responses, in 
the discussion below.  
6. NGSO FSS Order.  On September 26, 2017, following the close of the comment cycle in this 
proceeding, the Commission adopted a Report and Order updating several rules and policies governing 
NGSO FSS systems, including the proposed SpaceX system.
25
  Among other changes, the Commission 
adopted EPFD limits on NGSO FSS systems operating in portions of the 17.8-20.2 GHz and 27.5-30 GHz 
frequency bands in order to protect GSO FSS networks.  The Commission also adopted a more flexible 
17
 Space X Consolidated Opposition and Response at 22 (filed July 7, 2017) (SpaceX Opposition).  SpaceX agrees 
with Telesat’s request that any authorization granted in this processing round be conditioned upon compliance with 
rules adopted in the NGSO NPRM proceeding, including in-line avoidance mechanisms.  SpaceX Opposition at 31.

 Application, Waiver Requests at 1-2.  OneWeb Comments at 3-11; SES and 03b Comments at 10 and Hughes 
Reply Comments at 2 (filed July 7, 2017).  Hughes also opposes waiver of the downlink PFD limits in the 18.8-19.3 
GHz band.  Id. at 3-4.

milestone schedule for NGSO constellations.  As these changes are now in effect,
26
 we consider below 
their pertinence to the public interest analysis required to act upon the SpaceX Application.
III. DISCUSSION
7. After review of the record, we conclude that grant of the SpaceX Application, as 
supplemented,
27
 will serve the public interest, subject to the requirements and conditions specified herein.  
Below, we address the various outstanding issues raised by commenters on SpaceX’s Application and 
Supplemental Application.  We also address SpaceX’s waiver requests.  Where appropriate, we defer 
matters of general applicability to ongoing or potential future rulemakings.
8. ITU Coordination.  In its Petition to Deny, Telesat observes that international coordination 
will be required between the SpaceX system and its own NGSO FSS system.
28
  Telesat argues that, at 
minimum, any grant to SpaceX should be conditioned upon compliance with this international obligation.  
In response, SpaceX argues in support of the Commission’s avoidance of in-line interference regime, 
which, it asserts, yields more efficient spectrum sharing results than a regime based solely upon ITU 
priority.
29
  We recently declined to adopt Telesat’s proposal to tie coordination obligations and licensing 
conditions directly to ITU filing dates by awarding priority according to those dates,
30
 and accordingly 
deny Telesat’s petition in so far as it reiterates Telesat’s ITU filing date priority proposal.  We include a 
condition requiring SpaceX, like all other NGSO FSS operators, to comply with the spectrum sharing 
requirements specified in section 25.261 of the Commission’s rules with respect to any other NGSO 
system licensed or granted U.S. market access pursuant to the processing rounds in which SpaceX 
participated.
31
  We recently adopted changes to section 25.261 that replaced the avoidance of in-line 
interference methodology for triggering spectrum division (absent coordination) with a default spectrum 
splitting sharing mechanism that is triggered when the change in system noise temperature caused by 
interference, or ?T/T, exceeds a threshold of 6 percent.
32
  However, we note that outside the United States 
(i.e., when communications to or from the U.S. territory are not involved) the coexistence between 
SpaceX’s operations and operations of a system that received a grant for access to the U.S. market are 
governed only by the ITU Radio Regulations as well as the regulations of the country where the earth 
station is located and are not subject to section 25.261.
9. EPFD Analysis.  Several commenters suggested that the EPFD analysis provided by SpaceX 
is insufficient and that the Commission should request a supplemental EPFD analysis.
33
  We disagree.  
We find that SpaceX’s demonstrations in its application and associated filings are sufficient to justify 
26
 These rules became effective January 17, 2018, except the amendments to Sections 25.114, 25.115, 25.146, and 
25.164, which contain information collection requirements that have not been approved by The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB).  See 82 Fed. Reg. 59972-01 (Dec. 18, 2017).  The Commission will publish a 
document in the Federal Register announcing such OMB approval and the effective date of these rule amendments.

grant of its application.  Furthermore, SpaceX has provided a revised EPFD analysis using ITU-approved 
software.
34
  To ensure that SpaceX will satisfy its EPFD obligations going forward, we condition this 
grant on SpaceX receiving a favorable or “qualified favorable” rating of its EPFD demonstration by the 
ITU prior to initiation of service.
35
 Review by the ITU of SpaceX compliance with ITU EPFD limits, 
using methods now approved by the ITU,
36
 will provide sufficient assurances beyond the other technical 
demonstrations that SpaceX has already provided that SpaceX will comply with the EPFD limits 
specified in Article 22 of the Radio Regulations.
10. As we did in other recent approvals for NGSO FSS operations,
37
 we are permitting SpaceX to 
operate up to the PFD and EPFD levels specified in applicable regulations, rather than the levels 
associated with specific demonstrations in its application.  We find this flexibility is warranted given the 
preliminary nature of the system design, the fact that this grant is conditioned on SpaceX’s satisfaction of 
the ITU’s EPFD assessment and the condition that SpaceX cooperate with other NGSO operators to meet 
limits for aggregate EPFD.  We therefore reject ViaSat’s arguments that SpaceX should be limited to the 
levels used in the EPFD demonstration in its application and deny this portion of ViaSat’s Petition to 
Deny.
38
11. Buffer Zone and Orbital Debris.  To avoid collisions with OneWeb satellites, OneWeb 
requested that grant of SpaceX’s application be conditioned on SpaceX maintaining “an approximate 125 
kilometer altitude buffer zone (the “Safety Buffer Zone”) between its constellation and other NGSO 
systems,” including OneWeb’s own NGSO system, subject to coordination.
39
  As a preliminary matter, 
the scope of OneWeb’s request is unclear and could be interpreted to request a buffer zone that spans 
altitudes between 1,015 and 1,385 kilometers.  Imposition of such a zone could effectively preclude the 
proposed operation of SpaceX’s system, and OneWeb has not provided legal or technical justification for 
a buffer zone of this size.  While we are concerned about the risk of collisions between the space stations 
of NGSO systems operating at similar orbital altitudes, we think that these concerns are best addressed in 
the first instance through inter-operator coordination.  At this stage, we do not believe it appropriate to 
specify the methods for effecting coordination, which may involve a wide range of changes in system 
design and operations.  SpaceX will be subject to the same conditions as OneWeb, Telesat Canada, and 
Space Norway,
40
 including the requirement that it coordinate its physical operations with space stations of 
NGSO systems operating at similar orbital altitudes.  To the extent that SpaceX and other NGSO 
operators fail to come to an agreement regarding physical coordination, the Commission may intervene as 
appropriate.  
12. An applicant for a space station authorization must submit a description of the design and 
operational strategies that it will use to mitigate orbital debris, including a statement detailing post-

mission disposal plans for space stations at the end of their operating life.
 
41
  SpaceX included an orbital 
debris mitigation plan in its application.
42
  Thereafter, the Satellite Division (Division) sent a letter to 
SpaceX requesting additional information regarding its orbital debris mitigation plan.
43
  On April 20, 
2017, SpaceX provided answers to the Division’s questions.
44
  
13. In its comments, Spire Global (Spire) raises concerns about SpaceX’s orbital debris 
mitigation plan.  Specifically, Spire asserts that more information is needed regarding those NGSO 
applications, including SpaceX’s, with post-mission disposal plans through atmospheric re-entry so that 
existing operators can assess the risk from those disposals.
45
  OneWeb argues that SpaceX fails to provide 
critical information necessary for other NGSO operators to properly assess the potential for its 
constellation to become a source of orbital debris.
46
  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) also raises the general concern, mainly in response to SpaceX’s satellite constellation, that 
NGSO applicants seeking to deploy a large number of satellites (i.e., over 4,000) may need to ensure a 
higher degree of reliability in their post-mission disposal operations than NASA’s current 90% reliability 
standard.
47
14. In its reply, SpaceX agrees that given the number of NGSO systems that may be launched 
over the next decade, physical coordination between systems may be required.
48
  SpaceX further agrees 
that operators should share satellite location data and other information that will allow all systems to 
coexist safely in space.
49
  Regarding OneWeb’s concern about collisions between SpaceX satellites, 
SpaceX states that the tolerances of the specified orbital parameters afford sufficient flexibility to achieve 
necessary spacing between satellites, and it has designed its spacecraft with the capability to avoid 
potential collisions, which it can use as necessary to ensure safe operating distances.
50
  SpaceX indicates 
that it will receive ephemeris data from its own spacecraft, which will provide precise location 
information and thereby enable SpaceX to operate with a high level of confidence with respect to 
potential conjunctions.  SpaceX notes that it continues to refine its operational strategies to enhance 
safety, citing “an ongoing simulation corroborating probabilities between information from the Joint 
Space Operations Center (JSpOC) and the predictions of NASA’s Orbital Debris Engineering Model, 
which is used to analyze collision risks under different maneuver protocols.”
51
  SpaceX argues that it has 
provided more detailed information and analysis related to its orbital debris mitigation and end-of-life 
disposal plans than any other applicant in this processing round, including:  (1) a demonstration that 
SpaceX satellites will re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere within approximately one year after completion of 
their mission – much sooner than the international standard of 25 years, and (2) the inputs and outputs of 
an assessment using NASA’s Debris Assessment Software (DAS), which indicates a level of safety that

exceeds the requirements established by NASA and regulatory authorities in other countries.
52
  SpaceX 
states it is also working directly with NASA on a higher fidelity re-entry analysis, employing NASA’s 
proprietary Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool (ORSAT), a more comprehensive model that provides 
a greater level of precision and insight over the standard DAS analysis that can help guide SpaceX as it 
continues to refine its system and operations.
53
15. Although we appreciate the level of detail and analysis that SpaceX has provided for its 
orbital debris mitigation and end-of-life disposal plans, we agree with NASA that the unprecedented 
number of satellites proposed by SpaceX and the other NGSO FSS systems in this processing round will 
necessitate a further assessment of the appropriate reliability standards of these spacecraft, as well as the 
reliability of these systems’ methods for deorbiting the spacecraft.
54
  
Pending further study,
55
 it would be 
premature to grant SpaceX’s application based on its current orbital debris mitigation plan.  Accordingly, 
we believe it is appropriate to condition grant of SpaceX’s application on the Commission’s approval of 
an updated description of the orbital debris mitigation plans for its system.
56
  
16. Matters Broadly Applicable to NGSO FSS Applications.  Hughes urges the Commission to 
adopt mechanisms for ensuring that aggregate EPFD limits are met by all NGSO systems authorized in 
the United States.
57
  ViaSat questions the sufficiency of the EPFD limits proposed by the Commission to 
protect GSO systems from harmful interference and requests that each NGSO operator be held jointly and 
severally liable for harmful interference caused to GSO systems until the Commission adopts adequate 
aggregate EPFD limits and enforcement mechanisms.
58
  Space Norway requests that grant of SpaceX’s 
application be conditioned on SpaceX’s implementation of mechanisms to avoid in-line interference with 
highly elliptical orbit NGSO systems, such as that proposed by Space Norway.
59
  Spire states that the 
Commission should condition grant of these applications on the outcome of future rulemakings, 
specifically if the Commission adopts any new orbital debris requirements.

addressed in the context of a rulemaking.  Several of these issues were already raised in the then-ongoing

 NASA Comments (filed June 26, 2017) (noting that (1) the reliability of the design and fabrication of the 
spacecraft and the reliability that the spacecraft can accomplish the post-mission disposal are of particular interest 
from the perspective of keeping the orbital environment safe, and that currently, no consensus exists on what the two 
reliability numbers should be, and (2) a design and fabrication reliability on the order of 0.999 or better per 
spacecraft may be prudent to mitigate the risk of malfunction in a 4,000+ spacecraft constellation).
55
 In addition to the ongoing work by SpaceX, we also note that NASA identifies two studies, currently underway, 
that may shed light on best practices for large satellite constellations: NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office 
(ODPO) is performing an internal parametric study which will be completed by May of this year, and the IADC 
study on large constellations will take another year or so to complete.  In the meantime, NASA recommends that 
companies proposing large constellations should develop ways to deal with random failures such that they not pose a 
threat to other U.S. assets including the International Space Station.  Id.

rulemaking proceeding concerning NGSO FSS matters
61
 that were addressed in a Report and Order 
adopted September 26, 2017.
62
  For example, Hughes and ViaSat express concerns about international 
EPFD limits and aggregate EPFD enforcement mechanisms, and these concerns have since been 
addressed in the NGSO FSS Order.
63
  Space Norway’s request for a condition requiring SpaceX to protect 
the Space Norway NGSO system as though it were a GSO space station is in effect a request that the 
Commission reevaluate its licensing procedures with regard to an entire class of NGSO systems, i.e., 
those with highly-elliptical orbits.  As indicated above, we defer consideration of such broadly applicable 
matters to future rulemakings, and condition grant of the SpaceX application on the outcome of such 
rulemaking proceedings, including the most recent NGSO FSS decision.
64
  We note that, as with the 
OneWeb Order, Telesat Canada Order, and Space Norway Order, grant of the SpaceX application will not 
prejudge any decision, including a contrary action, in any future rulemaking proceedings.
65
  Rather, 
decisions of general applicability in such proceedings will be based on the totality of comments and 
proposals in those proceedings, including SpaceX’s.
66
  Accordingly, in addition to being subject to any 
future proceedings, SpaceX would have to comply with any new orbital debris requirements.
18. Radio Astronomy.  Out-of-band signals into allocated radio astronomy bands can cause 
interference to radio astronomy observations.
 67
  We also note that radio astronomy as a service frequently 
makes use of observations (passive) in bands not allocated to the radio astronomy service.  This practice 
is a result of scientifically valuable signals being subject to the Doppler Effect and shifted in frequency 
outside radio astronomy-allocated bands.  Although not a condition to this authorization, SpaceX should 
be aware of these facts and contact the National Science Foundation Spectrum Management Unit 
(esm@nsf.gov) to assist with coordination and information on radio astronomy sites.
19. Conditions.  Below, we condition this grant of authority in response to comments and as 
warranted in the public interest.  These conditions relate to ITU coordination, power limits, avoidance of 
interference, orbital debris mitigation, future rulemakings, bond and milestone requirements, and other 
existing requirements in our rules and in footnotes to the Table of Frequency Allocations.  We also 
include specific conditions related to our waiver grants.  To the extent that the SpaceX application raises 
the same concerns as those raised in the recent proceedings for addressing market access for NGSO FSS 
operations in the United States, e.g., OneWeb, Space Norway, Telesat, we impose substantially identical 
conditions on SpaceX’s grant.  In their comments, SES/O3b asks that we impose on any grant for the

62
 See generally NGSO FSS Order. 
63
 Recently, we considered ViaSat’s concerns regarding the sufficiency of existing international EPFD limits and 
found that although ViaSat had not proposed any new EPFD limits, it would not be advisable to remain without Ka-
band EPFD limits in our rules pending such deliberations.  Thus we adopted the ITU EPFD limits in the 17.8-30 
GHz frequency range and require NGSO FSS licensees to comply with existing aggregate EPFD limits.  See NGSO 
FSS Order at 7820-21, para. 35.
64
 We note that this condition also addresses several comments that requested that grant of SpaceX’s application be 
conditioned on compliance with certain pending and future rulemakings.  See ViaSat Petition to Deny at 3, 7, 9-10; 
Spire Comments at 3, 5, 7; Hughes Reply at 2.

SpaceX system the same conditions that were imposed on O3b’s NGSO FSS constellation.
68
  Since the 
O3b grant however, the Commission has adopted significant revisions to its rules and policies governing 
NGSO FSS.  The conditions below are consistent with these rule changes. 
69
20. Waiver Standard.  SpaceX seeks waivers of certain Commission rules.
70
  Generally, the 
Commission may waive any rule for good cause shown.
71
  Waiver is appropriate where the particular 
facts make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.
72
  In making this determination, we may 
take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy 
on an individual basis.
73
  Waiver is therefore appropriate if special circumstances warrant a deviation 
from the general rule and such deviation will serve the public interest.
74
  We address the specific requests 
for waivers below.
21. Waivers for Frequency Use.  SpaceX requests waivers of the U.S. Table of Frequency 
Allocations (Table), to perform NGSO FSS operations in the 17.8-18.6 GHz band.
75
  SpaceX’s proposed 
operations in the 17.8-18.6 GHz band, however, are in conformance with the Table as revised in the 
NGSO FSS Order.
76
  Thus, SpaceX’s request for waivers of the Table to perform NGSO FSS operations 
in the 17.8-18.6 GHz band are moot.  
22. SpaceX also requests a waiver of section 25.202(a)(1), n.6, in order to permit SpaceX to 
operate its user terminal earth stations in the 10.7-11.7 GHz band on a non-conforming, non-interference, 
unprotected basis.
77
  We believe this request is more appropriately addressed in the context of an earth 
station application, since the request ultimately concerns the status of earth station operations.  
Accordingly, we dismiss the waiver request without prejudice to resubmission in connection with an 
application to operate earth stations with the SpaceX system.  We observe, however, that we recently 
modified our rules concerning the use of the 10.7-11.7 GHz band to permit blanket licensing of receive 
earth stations on an unprotected basis.
78
  
23. Waivers for 19.7-20.2 GHz.  SpaceX seeks a waiver of the Commission’s Ka-band Plan to 
operate in the 19.7-20.2 GHz frequency band.
79
  The 19.7-20.2 GHz frequency band is allocated to the

 To the extent that O3b is concerned about the status of its current and future operations relative to other NGSO 
systems, we note that, as a participant in the processing rounds, such concerns will be addressed when the 
Commission acts on O3b’s pending petition.  See O3b Limited, IBFS File Nos. SAT-AMD-20161115-00116 and

fixed-satellite service and mobile-satellite service (space-to-Earth) on a primary basis,
80
 however, the 
Commission’s Ka-band Plan designates this band for the use of the GSO FSS, rather than NGSO FSS 
systems.
81
  In the SpaceX Supplemental Application, SpaceX provided technical demonstrations to show 
that it will comply with international EPFD limits designed to protect GSO networks in the 19.7-20.2 
GHz frequency band set forth in Article 22 of the ITU Radio Regulations.  In addition, SpaceX states that 
it will not cause harmful interference to and is willing to accept interference from GSO FSS operators in 
this frequency band.
82
  SES argues that the Commission must condition SpaceX’s authorization in the 
19.7-20.2 GHz band to not interfere with SES’s operations as well as other GSO systems, to which 
SpaceX responded.
83
24. In light of the proposal that the Commission recently adopted to allow NGSO FSS operations 
in this band on a secondary basis, subject to certain power limits,
84
 SpaceX’s request for waiver of the 
Commission’s Ka-band Plan to operate in the 19.7-20.2 GHz frequency band is moot.  
25. Waiver of Band-Splitting Procedure.  SpaceX seeks to operate in the United States 
throughout the 10.7-12.7 GHz, 12.75-13.25, 13.85-14.5 GHz, 17.8-18.6 GHz, 18.8-19.3 GHz, 19.7-20.2 
GHz, 27.5-29.1 GHz, and 29.5-30 GHz frequency bands.  In some of these frequency bands, specifically 
in those included in the 10.7-12.7 GHz, 12.75-13.25 GHz, 13.75-14.5 GHz, 18.8-19.3 GHz and 28.6-29.1 
GHz bands, the Commission has adopted rules and policies to allow shared use of frequencies among 
NGSO FSS systems by avoidance of interference events.
85
  In other bands, section 25.157(e) of the 
Commission’s rules provides for “available spectrum” to be “divided equally” among the applications 
granted as the result of a processing round.
86
  This rule presumes that NGSO operators cannot use the 
same frequencies without causing harmful interference to each other, and therefore must be assigned 
discrete segments of the requested band.  SpaceX requests a waiver of section 25.157(e) to permit it to 
share the 17.8-18.6 GHz, 19.7-20.2 GHz, 27.5-28.6 GHz, and 29.5-30 GHz bands with other NGSO FSS 
operators through avoidance of interference events, rather than by assignment of only a portion of these 
bands.
26. Based on our technical review of the SpaceX Application and of other applications and 
petitions that were submitted in the OneWeb processing round, we conclude that sharing will be possible 
between the SpaceX system, the OneWeb system, and other proposed NGSO FSS systems in all of the 
bands requested by SpaceX.  The earth stations that will communicate with the SpaceX constellation will 
have directional antennas.
87
  This directionality, which permits avoidance of interference with other 
NGSO FSS systems in the 10.7-12.7 GHz,

GHz bands, also permits avoidance of interference in the 17.8-18.6 GHz, 19.7-20.2 GHz, 27.5-28.6 GHz, 
and 29.5-30 GHz bands.  Thus, because SpaceX’s particular system design enables sharing by avoiding 
interference events in all requested bands, division of available spectrum would be unnecessarily 
restrictive.
27. Furthermore, we recently adopted changes to the Commission’s rules that will apply a 
spectrum sharing mechanism to all NGSO FSS systems that have sharing capabilities (e.g., directional 
earth station antennas), regardless of the frequency bands used.
89
  Thus, SpaceX’s request for waiver of 
section 25.157(e) is moot.
28. Waivers for EPFD Software Code. Section 25.146 requires NGSO FSS applicants in certain 
bands to use software to demonstrate that their systems will comply with EPFD limits included in section 
25.208.
90
  If software approved by the ITU is not available, applicants must provide the source code used.  
SpaceX used a beta version of EPFD software in development with the ITU, Transfinite, a final version of 
which was subsequently approved by the ITU.
91
  SpaceX requests waiver of the requirement to provide its 
source code in light of the proprietary nature of the third-party software, and given that its version had not 
been approved by the ITU at the time of use.  
29. We find good cause for waiver of the source code requirement in sections 25.146(a)(1)(iii), 
(2)(iii), based on SpaceX’s use of this software in development with the ITU, but condition the grant on 
the requirement that SpaceX satisfactorily undergo the ITU review process of its EPFD demonstration 
prior to initiation of service.  Review by the ITU of SpaceX’s compliance with ITU EPFD limits, using 
methods now approved by the ITU, will provide sufficient additional assurances that SpaceX will comply 
with the applicable EPFD limits beyond the other technical demonstrations SpaceX has already 
provided.
92
  Thus, grant of this waiver will not undermine the purpose of the rule to reasonably ensure 
compliance with the relevant EPFD limits.
93
30. Waiver of 47 CFR § 25.202(g)(1).  We grant SpaceX’s request for waiver of section 
25.202(g)(1) to permit telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) operations in the 13.85-14.0 GHz 
band, as conditioned.  Section 25.202(g)(1) requires that TT&C signals be transmitted within assigned 
frequency bands, preferably at the band edges.  We find that grant of this waiver is warranted.  First, the 
requested band is immediately adjacent to the 14.0-14.5 GHz band used by the SpaceX system for user 
terminal uplink transmissions and, second, SpaceX anticipates that it will provide TT&C from only two 
locations in the United States (on the East and West Coasts respectively).  In addition, since SpaceX’s 
operations in the 13.85-14.0 GHz band must be coordinated with other spectrum users, this will further 
reduce the likelihood of interference to other operations.  
(Continued from previous page)  
FCC, (dated March 6, 2018).  Such concerns are addressed in paragraphs 40(e) and 40(r) below, requiring SpaceX to

future rules or policies adopted by the Commission in pending rulemaking proceedings.  See, e.g., Petition of 
MVDDS 5G Coalition for Rulemaking, RM-11768 (filed Apr. 26, 2016).

31. Waiver of Milestone Requirement.  SpaceX requests waiver of section 25.164(b) of the 
Commission’s rules, which requires NGSO system licensees to launch the space stations, place them into 
the assigned orbits, and operate them in accordance with the station authorization within six years of grant 
of the license.
94
  SpaceX asks that we apply the six-year milestone only to its initial deployment of 1,600 
satellites.
95
  SpaceX states that completing its full constellation of over 4,400 satellites over a six-year 
period would require a launch cadence of more than 60 satellites per month, beginning on the day the 
Commission grants a license, which would be impractical, and that deployment of its full constellation is 
not necessary to allow it to commence delivery of broadband service.  SpaceX argues that a limited 
waiver of section 25.164(b) would not undermine the purpose of the milestone requirements, as it would 
not result in, facilitate, or encourage spectrum warehousing.  Several commenters argue that a waiver of 
this requirement would give SpaceX an unfair advantage as it would not require SpaceX to deploy its full 
constellation within the six-year period without further obligation to deploy the rest of its system.
96 
  
32. We agree with commenters that SpaceX has not provided sufficient grounds for a waiver of 
the Commission’s final implementation milestone requirement.  We note that this issue was addressed in 
the NGSO FSS rulemaking,
97
 and this grant is subject to those rules.  Under these new rules, SpaceX’s 
deployment of 1600 satellites would not meet the new 6-year milestone requirement that now requires 50 
percent of the total number of satellites in the constellation to be launched and operated no later than 6 
years after grant of the authorization.  Given that, we deny SpaceX’s waiver request.  SpaceX can 
resubmit this request in the future, when it will have more information about the progress of the 
construction and launching of its satellites and will therefore be in a better position to assess the need and 
justification for a waiver.
33. Geographic Coverage Requirements.  SpaceX’s requests a partial waiver of sections 
25.145(c) and 25.146(i) of the Commission’s rules.
98
  Sections 25.145(c) and 25.146(i) require NGSO 
FSS systems using certain Ka- and Ku-band frequencies, respectively, to provide service coverage to (i) 
all locations as far north as 70 degrees latitude and as far south at 55 degrees latitude for at least 75% of 
every 24-hour period and (ii) on a continuous basis throughout the fifty states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.
 
99
  SpaceX states that once fully deployed, the SpaceX system will satisfy these 
requirements, as it will provide full time coverage to virtually the entire planet.
100
 The initial deployment, 
however, will cover only as far north as 60 degrees latitude.  SpaceX argues that its system, when fully 
deployed, will meet the requirements of these rules, and thus it should be granted a waiver of the 
94
 47 CFR § 25.164(b).
95
 Application, Waiver Requests at 8-10.  SpaceX indicates that its initial deployment of 1,600 satellites within the

geographic coverage requirements for its initial deployment.  OneWeb argues that waiver of these 
requirements is not in the public interest and should be denied.
 101
  We find that waivers of sections 
25.145(c) and 25.146(i) are unnecessary, since the Commission’s geographic service rules apply to the 
“proposed system”, which in the case of SpaceX is the full system of 4,425 satellites that was proposed 
and authorized.  Given that SpaceX’s proposed system as a whole will meet the geographic coverage 
requirements, a waiver of the requirements is not needed for interim stages and we therefore dismiss 
SpaceX’s waiver request.
34. Section 25.208(e).  SpaceX states that it does not comply with the PFD limits established in 
section 25.208(e) for very low elevation angles due to the flawed interference calculation methodology 
applied in the rule.  It argues that the calculation methodology was not designed for (and did not 
contemplate) larger constellations, and assumes downlink energy from all satellites in operation, not just 
those that are visible from a particular location that could meaningfully be expected to contribute to 
interference into a terrestrial FS system, and fails to discount interference from those satellites that are 
switched off at a particular time or designed not to serve a location at such a low elevation angle.
102
  
SpaceX further argues that when the calculation methodology is revised to reflect more reasonable 
operating assumptions for larger systems, it becomes clear that the SpaceX System would not be expected 
to cause harmful interference into terrestrial FS systems that share the band.
103
  OneWeb urges the 
Commission to deny SpaceX’s request for a waiver of the Commission’s downlink PFD limits to ensure 
that SpaceX’s operations do not cause harmful interference to terrestrial operations, criticizes SpaceX’s 
understanding of the applicable PFD limits and states that NGSO FSS systems must comply with the 
Commission’s downlink PFD requirements as described in footnote US334 of the U.S. Table of 
Frequency Allocations and further reflected in Section 25.208(e) of its rules.
104
  Hughes agrees with 
OneWeb and other commenters that a waiver of section 25.208(e) could have an impact on Hughes’ 
current and future broadband satellite systems, and would contravene the obligations imposed by Article 
21 of the ITU Radio Regulations.
105
  
35. The NGSO FSS Order eliminated section 25.208(e), but adopted a new application 
requirement for NGSO applicants that requires a certification that the NGSO FSS applicant will comply 
with any applicable PFD levels in Article 21 of the ITU Radio Regulations.
106
  Although this provision is 
not yet effective, the Commission recently affirmed the application of these PFD limits to NGSO FSS 
systems in the 17.7-19.7 GHz bands.
107
  Therefore, rather than considering the request for a waiver of 
25.208(e), it is more appropriate to address SpaceX compliance with the ITU PFD limits applicable in the 
17.7-19.7 GHz frequency band.  In this respect, we agree with several of the points raised by SpaceX, in 
particular that the ITU limits were derived for constellations up to 840 satellites and under worst case 
assumptions.  The Commission contemplated that it would rely on its waiver policy to address, on a case-
by-case basis, whether the ITU PFD limits should be modified for a given large NGSO constellation.

However, we find that SpaceX has not provided sufficient information in its application to justify that its

operation will adequately protect terrestrial operations in the band under consideration, and thus we deny 
its request for waiver.  We recognize that such showing may have to rely on specific operational 
considerations that may be not fully known at this point in time.  Given this, as a condition to this 
authorization, SpaceX must file a modification application before starting operation with a technical 
showing that demonstrates that its operation will protect a fixed-service station with the characteristics 
described in Recommendation ITU-R SF.1483.
109
36. Schedule S Waiver.  As required by the Commission’s rules, SpaceX submitted a completed 
Schedule S for its application, which contains certain technical information in a prescribed form.  This is 
the first NGSO processing round in which the new version of the Schedule S has been used.  SpaceX has 
found that it cannot accurately describe its system in certain respects due to limitations in Schedule S 
itself.  SpaceX cites four limitations in Schedule S that affected how the Schedule S was completed:  (1) 
the inability to enter for section 25.114(c)(4)(v) both the minimum and maximum saturation flux density 
(SFD) values for each space station receive antenna; (2)  the inability to enter a negative value for the 
maximum transmit EIRP density value for each beam; (3) the inability to enter a maximum PFD value for 
any given angle of arrival for NGSO systems operating in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band that is less than -200.0 
dBW/m2/BW; and (4) the lack of a means to reflect SpaceX’s system architecture for spare satellites.
110
  
To the extent necessary, SpaceX requests that the Commission waive these aspects of Schedule S in light 
of these limitations.  In view of the fact that SpaceX has implemented a workaround for each of these 
limitations to allow entry of the required information, we find that a waiver of the requirement to 
complete certain aspects or fields of Schedule S is warranted.
37. Other.  In the 14-14.2 GHz band, NASA operates Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System 
facilities at three locations:  Guam (latitude 13°36?55? N, longitude 144°51?22? E); White Sands, New 
Mexico (latitude 32°20?59? N, longitude 106°36?31? W and latitude 32°32?40? N, longitude 106°36?48? 
W); and Blossom Point, Maryland.  For transmissions in the 14-14.2 GHz band from NGSO FSS earth 
stations located within 125 kilometers of these three sites, earth station operators should take account of 
these NASA facilities.
IV. CONCLUSION 
38. We conclude that grant of the SpaceX Application and Supplemental Application, as 
conditioned and set forth herein, will serve the public interest by enabling SpaceX to pursue its goal of 
providing broadband service to consumers in the United States and around the world.

A next-generation space race is unfolding.  We are seeing new commercial models, 
players, and technologies coming together to pioneer a wide range of cool satellite services.  This 
is undeniably exciting.
However, this rush to develop new space opportunities requires new rules.  Despite the 
revolutionary activity in our atmosphere, the regulatory frameworks we rely on to shape these 
efforts are dated.  They were designed for a time when going to space was astronomically 
expensive and limited to the prowess of our political superpowers.  No one imagined commercial 
tourism taking hold, no one believed crowd-funded satellites were possible, and no one could 
have conceived of the sheer popularity of space entrepreneurship.
Across the board, we need to prepare for the proliferation of satellites in our higher 
altitudes.  In short, we have work to do.  There are two places we can start.    
First, the FCC has to tackle the growing challenge posed by orbital debris.  Today, the 
risk of debris-generating collusions is reasonably low.  But they’ve already happened—and as 
more actors participate in the space industry and as more satellites of smaller size that are harder 
to track are launched, the frequency of these accidents is bound to increase.  Unchecked, growing 
debris in orbit could make some regions of space unusable for decades to come.  That is why we 
need to develop a comprehensive policy to mitigate collision risks and ensure space 
sustainability.  
Second, the FCC must coordinate more closely with other federal actors to figure out 
what our national policies are for this jumble of new space activity.  Right now, the National 
Space Council is considering policy changes to help promote the growth of the commercial space 
industry.  Their efforts encompass everything from streamlining licenses to reforming export 
controls to protecting airwaves facilitating space activities.  Its membership spans the civil, 
military, and commercial sectors, including the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, 
Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National 
Intelligence.  Representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, also serve on this council.  
It’s an impressive list.  But the FCC should have a seat at this table.  It’s a glaring omission that 
the agency does not because through our oversight of the airwaves and licensing of satellite 
services we have an important role ensuring the viability of space for future generations.  Cutting 
the FCC out of this discussion is an unseemly mistake—and one that deserves a fix.

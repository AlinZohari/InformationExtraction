ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION
Adopted:  August 1, 2016 Released:  August 1, 2016
By the Chief, Satellite Division, International Bureau; and Acting Chief, Policy and Rules Division, Office 
of Engineering and Technology:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. By this Order, we authorize Iridium Constellation LLC (Iridium) to construct, deploy, 
and operate non-geostationary-satellite orbit (NGSO) space stations to continue and enhance its provision 
of mobile-satellite service (MSS) and aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S).  This 
authorization will allow Iridium to continue to provide mobile voice and data services to end users on a 
network with improved voice quality and enhanced data transmission speeds.
II. BACKGROUND
2. Current constellation.  Iridium operates an NGSO satellite constellation capable of 
providing MSS anywhere in the world.  Originally licensed in 1995,1 the Iridium system is authorized for 
66 service satellites, plus any co-located satellites,2 and up to 14 in-orbit spares.3 The constellation 
operates in a near-circular Earth orbit at an altitude of 778 kilometers,4 and is arranged in six orbital

planes at an inclination of 86.4 degrees.5 Iridium satellites use an array of spot beams to communicate 
with subscriber units.  They connect to “gateway” earth stations through feeder links.6 Within the 
constellation, adjacent satellites communicate with each other via inter-satellite links.7
3. The Iridium constellation is assigned frequencies in the L-band, the Ka-band, and the 
23.18-23.38 GHz band.8 Service links are authorized in the 1617.775-1626.5 MHz band for transmission 
in both directions between mobile earth stations and Iridium satellites.9 Communication between 
satellites is authorized in the 23.18-23.38 GHz band.10 Feeder links and telemetry, tracking, and 
command (TT&C) operations are authorized in the 19.4-19.6 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 29.1-29.3 GHz 
(Earth-to-space) bands.11 Iridium shares the 29.25-29.3 GHz feeder uplink band on a co-primary basis 
with geostationary-satellite orbit (GSO) space stations in the fixed-satellite service (FSS).12
4. As a result of a license modification granted in 2013, Iridium is also authorized to 
provide AMS(R)S in the 1618.725-1626.5 MHz band to remote, oceanic and polar regions.13 AMS(R)S 
is an aeronautical mobile-satellite service reserved for communications relating to safety and regularity of 
flights, primarily along national or international civil air routes.14 On May 22, 2014, we granted an 
  
5 First Generation License, 10 FCC Rcd at 2268, para. 2.
6 Id. In the NGSO MSS, fixed feeder-link earth stations are needed to complete the transmission paths with mobile 
user terminals, process the information being transmitted, and interconnect the NGSO MSS system with terrestrial 
communications networks and with other user transceivers.  Feeder-link earth stations that distribute information to, 
and receive information from, terrestrial telecommunication networks, e.g., the public switched telephone network 
and the Internet, are known as gateways.  Iridium commercial traffic is routed through a central gateway located in 
Tempe, Arizona (Call Sign E960131).  Comments of Iridium Constellation LLC, File No. SES-MFS-20111104-

extension of the license term for Iridium’s first-generation satellites, to January 31, 2018, based on 
Iridium’s description of the planned deployment of its second-generation satellites.15
5. Modification application.  On December 27, 2013, Iridium filed an application to modify 
its NGSO MSS license to operate a second-generation satellite system.16 Iridium proposes to replace its 
existing constellation with a new constellation using the same orbital parameters, providing the same 
global coverage, and transmitting on the same frequency bands.17 Like Iridium’s first-generation 
satellites, the new satellites will be capable of operating in the entire 1616-1626.5 MHz band; however, 
Iridium here requests no change from the operating frequencies specified for its first-generation 
satellites.18  To provide continuous service during the transition, Iridium proposes to replace its existing 
satellites one-for-one with new satellites as they are launched.19 Iridium expects to have entirely replaced 
its first-generation constellation shortly after completing a series of launches.20 Iridium also requests 
authority for up to 15 second-generation in-orbit spare satellites,21 and to reserve the option to retain some 
first-generation satellites as potential spares.22
6. Iridium states that its second-generation satellites will also be equipped to track ships and 
aircraft.  Aircraft tracking will be accomplished through an Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast 
(ADS-B) receiver as part of a joint venture with Aireon LLC.23 The receiver will receive Extended 
Squitter ADS-B messages from aircraft on the 1090 MHz center frequency, and information regarding 
those messages will be relayed through the Iridium inter-satellite links and feeder downlinks to earth 
stations.24 The ADS-B information will then be routed to air traffic control authorities, thereby providing 
a global, satellite-based aviation monitoring service.
7. Iridium has also contracted with Harris Corporation to include a receiver for Automatic 
Identification System (AIS) messages on up to 65 of its second-generation satellites.  AIS is a shipboard 
broadcast system that transmits a marine vessel’s identification and position to aid in navigation and

maritime safety.  The satellite AIS receiver will receive AIS messages within the 156.0125-162.0375 
MHz band and, as with the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B receiver, information regarding those 
messages will be relayed through the Iridium inter-satellite links and feeder downlinks.  On October 22, 
2015, Iridium filed an amendment to its modification application with additional information regarding 
the AIS receiver.25
8. Iridium requests waiver of several Commission rules in its Second Generation 
Application.26 First, Iridium seeks waiver of section 25.210(i)(1), which requires that space station 
antennas in the FSS be designed to provide a cross-polarization isolation of 30 dB within their primary 
coverage area.27 Second, Iridium requests waiver of section 25.202(g) to allow TT&C operations 
throughout its assigned Ka-band feeder-link frequencies, rather than solely at the band edges.28 Third, 
Iridium seeks waivers of sections 25.114(d)(14)(ii) and 25.283(c) to maintain residual energy sources on 
board its satellites at their at end-of-life.29 Finally, Iridium states that the design of its second-generation 
satellites, which use on-board processors and regenerative payloads, renders inapplicable certain technical 
information requested in section 25.114(c)(4)(vi) and (vii).30 Iridium requests waiver of those rules to the 
extent necessary.
9. Comments.  On February 28, 2014, we placed Iridium’s Second Generation Application 
on public notice.31 In response, three GSO FSS space station operators commented on the application.  
Inmarsat Inc. (Inmarsat) filed a petition to dismiss, deny, or hold in abeyance Iridium’s application.32  
SES Americom, Inc. (SES) filed a comment.33 ViaSat, Inc. (ViaSat) responded to Inmarsat’s and SES’s 
initial pleadings.34

Application Amendment).
26 Iridium requested waiver of additional rules in its Second Generation Application Amendment.  These requests 
are unopposed and discussed below.
27 Second Generation Application, Narrative at 12-13; 47 C.F.R. § 25.210(i)(1).  As noted below, this requirement is 
applicable to Iridium’s feeder-link operations, which are performed using frequencies allocated to the FSS.
28 Second Generation Application, Narrative at 15-16.  Section 25.202(g) requires TT&C functions to be conducted 
“at either or both edges of the allocated band(s).”  47 C.F.R. § 25.202(g).
29 Second Generation Application, Narrative at 13-15.  Section 25.114(d)(14)(ii) requires a demonstration that debris 
generation will not result from the conversion of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments 
the spacecraft.  Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy remaining at end-of-life. 47 C.F.R. § 
25.114(d)(14)(ii).  Section 25.283(c) requires that all stored energy sources be discharged at the satellite end-of-life.

generation system can share the 29.25-29.3 GHz band with GSO FSS operations.35 SES argues this 
demonstration is required by section 25.258(c).36 Inmarsat and ViaSat also argue that Iridium has not 
justified its requested waiver of the 30 dB cross-polarization isolation requirement in section 
25.210(i)(1).37 SES suggests that any waiver of sections 25.210(i)(1) or 25.202(g) should be granted only 
with certain conditions.38 Finally, both Inmarsat and ViaSat ask that Iridium provide additional 
information regarding its 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B receiver.39
11. Iridium filed an opposition to the initial pleadings of Inmarsat and SES and replied to 
ViaSat.40 Inmarsat and SES replied to Iridium in turn.41 In its reply, Inmarsat specifies that Iridium 
should not be granted heightened interference protection for its Ka-band feeder links if they are used to 
support the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B receiver.42 In addition, the Committee on Radio 
Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) filed letters 
with the Commission regarding potential interference by Iridium out-of-band emissions from its second-
generation constellation into radio astronomy service (RAS) observations in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz 
band.43 Finally, Ligado Networks LLC (Ligado) filed a request to hold in abeyance the Iridium 
application.44 In separate proceedings, Iridium has contended that Ligado’s proposed operation of an 
ancillary terrestrial component to its mobile-satellite service network will harm Iridium’s second-
generation operations.  Ligado asks that we delay action on Iridium’s application pending further 
exploration of the compatibility of the two systems.
12. Part 25 Second Report and Order.  After the closing of the comment periods in this 
proceeding, the Commission adopted an Order comprehensively revising part 25 of its rules.45 Among 
the revisions, the Commission eliminated or relaxed several requirements from which Iridium seeks

ViaSat Response is, in fact, a late-filed opposition to its Second Generation Application.  Iridium Reply at 1 n.2; see 
also 47 C.F.R. § 25.154(a).  Assuming arguendo this were the case, we would still be able to consider the ViaSat 
Response as an informal objection under section 25.154(b), and would do so here.  See 47 C.F.R. § 25.154(b); News

waivers.  Because these rule changes are not yet in effect, we address the Commission’s decisions in the 
context of specific waiver requests, discussed below.
III. DISCUSSION
13. For the reasons discussed below, we grant Iridium’s application for a second-generation 
NGSO MSS constellation, subject to conditions.  In doing so, we decline to require the sharing 
demonstration for the 29.25-29.3 GHz band requested by GSO FSS commenters.
A. Sharing Analysis for the 29.25-29.3 GHz Band
14. Inmarsat, SES, and ViaSat request a demonstration from Iridium that its second-
generation satellite system will be compatible with co-primary GSO FSS operations in the 29.25-29.3 
GHz band.46 Inmarsat contends that such a demonstration is important given Iridium’s request for waiver 
of the cross-polarization isolation requirement in section 25.210(i)(1), which Inmarsat states can facilitate 
sharing.47 SES argues a sharing demonstration is required based on the “plain language” of section 
25.258(c).48 ViaSat supports the calls for a sharing demonstration.49 In response, Iridium states that it has 
provided all the information required concerning its proposed Ka-band use.50 Iridium notes that feeder-
link earth stations are already authorized in the 29.25-29.3 GHz band for communication with its current 
satellites.51 Iridium states that it seeks to continue this use with its new satellites without additional 
interference protection,52 and under existing coordination agreements.53
15. We decline to require the requested sharing demonstration.  The International Bureau has 
interpreted section 25.258(c) as an obligation on earth station applicants when seeking authority to 
transmit in the 29.25-29.3 GHz band.  Accordingly, the Bureau has declined to require such sharing 
demonstrations when addressing uplink reception in a space station authorization.54 We act consistent 
with this precedent.  Further, we note that Iridium Satellite LLC, the direct owner of Iridium,55 holds

can share with GSO FSS and NGSO MSS systems that have been authorized for operation in that band.”  47 C.F.R.

separate authorizations for feeder-link earth stations in the 29.25-29.3 GHz band.56 It provided 
demonstrations required under section 25.258(c) in earth station applications.57 Iridium indicates that its 
second-generation satellites will operate with the same feeder-link stations authorized to transmit to its 
current satellites.58 To the extent that modification of the radiofrequency operations of the existing 
stations is necessary to communicate with second-generation Iridium satellites, those stations must 
include in any modification application appropriate showings, including under section 25.258(c), for any 
proposed modified operations.59 We address Iridium’s request for waiver of section 25.210(i)(1) in 
Section III.E below.
B. Automatic Identification System Receiver
16. Iridium proposes to include an AIS receiver on up to 65 of its second-generation 
satellites.60 AIS is an international maritime navigation safety communications system through which 
marine vessels automatically transmit navigational data to appropriately equipped shore stations, other 
ships, and aircraft.61 The U.S. Coast Guard utilizes AIS for maritime domain awareness.62 Iridium 
proposes to receive AIS messages within the 156.0125-162.0375 MHz maritime very high frequency 
(VHF) band and to transmit the information through its inter-satellite links in the 23.18-23.38 GHz band 
and its feeder downlinks in the 19.4-19.6 GHz band.63 Command and control of the receiver would be

accomplished through Iridium TT&C operations in the 29.1-29.3 GHz uplink band.64
17. In the United States, the Commission has allocated the AIS 1 (161.9625-161.9875 MHz) 
and AIS 2 (162.0125-162.0375 MHz) bands to the MSS (Earth-to-space) on a co-primary basis for 
reception of AIS messages.65 The Commission has also proposed to allocate the long-range AIS 3 
(156.7625-156.7875 MHz) and AIS 4 (156.8125-156.8375 MHz) bands to the MSS (Earth-to-space) on a 
primary basis for AIS operations.66 The Commission has not adopted or proposed MSS allocations for 
the four other VHF frequencies with which Iridium is proposing to operate.
18. Internationally, the AIS 1, AIS 2, AIS 3, and AIS 4 bands are all allocated to the MSS 
(Earth-to-space) on a co-primary basis in Region 2 and on a secondary basis in Regions 1 and 3.67 There 
are no allocations, international or domestic, to the MSS in the 161.950 MHz (ASM 1),68 162.000 MHz 
(ASM 2), 156.525 MHz (DSC-R),69 or 156.8 MHz maritime mobile distress channels also requested by 
Iridium.
19. Iridium requests waivers of several rules to the extent necessary to authorize its proposed 
operations using VHF frequencies.70 Specifically, Iridium requests a waiver of the Table of Frequency 
Allocations, section 2.106, to permit operations in bands not allocated internationally and/or domestically 
for its requested operations.  Iridium also seeks waiver of section 25.112(a)(3), which states that an 
application will be considered defective if it requests authority to operate a space station in a frequency 
band not allocated internationally for such operations.71 In addition, Iridium states that certain default 
service rules, in section 25.287 and paragraphs (f) and (i) of section 25.210, are inappropriate to apply to 
its VHF receiver and seeks waivers of these rules to the extent necessary.72

69 DSC is an internationally approved system for automatically contacting vessels on medium frequency, high 
frequency, and VHF bands.  It allows mariners to send an automatically formatted distress alert instantly to the 
Coast Guard or other rescue authority anywhere in the world.  DSC also allows mariners to initiate or receive 
distress, urgency, safety and routine radiotelephone calls to or from any similarly equipped vessel or shore station, 
without requiring either party to be near a radio loudspeaker.  It allows users to “direct dial” and “ring” other 
maritime radio stations.

its AIS payload, below.

20. We may waive the Commission’s rules for good cause shown.73 Waiver is appropriate 
where the particular facts make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.74 In making this 
determination, we may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective 
implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.75 Waiver is therefore appropriate if special 
circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule and such deviation will serve the public interest.76
As noted above, only the AIS 1 and AIS 2 channels are currently allocated to the MSS in the U.S. Table 
of Frequency Allocations. The remaining use of frequencies Iridium requests for MSS (Earth-to-space) 
reception is therefore not in accordance with the U.S. Table of Frequency Allocations.
21. We waive section 2.102(a), on our own motion,77 and section 2.106, as requested, to 
permit Iridium’s proposed MSS (Earth-to-space) use of VHF bands in which there is no MSS allocation 
for the relevant use (domestic or international).  The Commission may grant a waiver of the Table of 
Frequency Allocations for non-conforming uses of spectrum when there is little potential for interference 
into any service authorized under the Table of Frequency Allocations and when the non-conforming 
operator accepts any interference from authorized services.78 The reception of transmissions, AIS or 
other, cannot cause harmful interference, and these transmissions will be present pursuant to existing 
authorizations using frequencies allocated to other services regardless of whether they are received by an 
Iridium second-generation satellite.  Further, we conclude that the service Iridium proposes, with its 
partner Harris Corporation, will serve the public interest by increasing maritime domain awareness for 
both government and commercial users.  Accordingly, we waive sections 2.102(a) and 2.106.  As a 
condition of this waiver, Iridium must not claim protection for reception of messages in the 156.0125-
162.0375 MHz band that is not in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations for the pertinent 
area, and may only claim protection to the extent provided by the status of the reception under the Table 
of Frequency Allocations.  In addition, we note that all reception in this band must comport with the 
requirements on unauthorized publication or use of communications in section 705 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.79
22. In addition, we waive section 25.112(a)(3) to permit consideration of Iridium’s request 
for operations on the channels 161.950 MHz (ASM 1), 162.000 MHz (ASM 2), 156.525 MHz (DSC-R), 
and 156.8 MHz (maritime mobile distress), which are not allocated internationally for the MSS.  In 2003, 
the Commission determined to return as “premature” such applications seeking to operate in frequencies 
for which there is no international allocation, because it can take several years for the ITU to adopt an 
international frequency allocation.80 The Commission also expressed concern that such applications 
would constitute “place holders.”  In this case, however, the lack of a current MSS allocation in these 
bands does not necessarily preclude initiation of service, as transmissions may be conducted under other

2.106, except as otherwise provided in other paragraphs of section 2.102.  Waiver of section 2.102(a) is necessary to 
authorize Iridium’s requested operations that are not in conformance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.

allocations.  Accordingly, we do not believe it would serve the public interest to prohibit Iridium the 
flexibility of including the capability to receive messages in the VHF receiver also on frequencies not 
allocated to the MSS.
23. In addition, we have examined the technical information regarding the VHF receiver and 
agree with Iridium that application of section 25.210(f) and (i) as default service rules are inappropriate in 
this instance.  We waive section 25.217(b) and these requirements accordingly.81 Because section 25.287 
contains requirements on earth stations, it is inapplicable to Iridium’s request for a space station 
authorization.
C. Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast Receiver
24. Iridium also proposes to include a 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B receiver on its 
second-generation satellites.  ADS-B is a service in which a transmitter periodically broadcasts 
information from and about an aircraft.  The information may include the aircraft’s identity, current 
position, altitude, and velocity, and it is broadcast to other ADS-B equipped aircraft and ADS-B ground 
stations, for distribution to air traffic control systems.82 Iridium’s proposed space-based reception of this 
information would allow aircraft to communicate ADS-B information to air traffic control systems while 
in areas where there are no ADS-B ground stations in view of the aircraft.
25. The 1090 MHz Extended Squitter83 broadcast link is used internationally for ADS-B 
services.84 The frequency band used for ADS-B, 1087.7-1092.3 MHz, was recently allocated 
internationally to the AMS(R)S (Earth-to-space) on a primary basis, limited to space station reception of 
ADS-B emissions from aircraft transmitters that operate in accordance with recognized international 
aeronautical standards.85 The U.S. Table of Frequency Allocations does not yet include this allocation.  
26. Iridium states that it plans for the ADS-B payload to be authorized by another 
administration, but has not provided additional information on the status of any such authorization.  
Lacking any additional information on the identity of the proposed authorizing authority, or on the status
of any pending application, we conditionally authorize Iridium operations using the 1087.7-1092.3 MHz 
frequency band.  As with the reception of AIS messages, we find good cause to waive sections 2.102(a) 
and 2.106 to permit reception of ADS-B messages on an unprotected basis in the United States because 
doing so will not cause any interference or unreasonably preclude other services.  Any future protection 
of ADS-B reception will be governed by the relevant status in the Table of Frequency Allocations and 
must be in accordance with any subsequent rulemaking proceedings to implement any new domestic 
allocations or service rules.
27. In response to the concern expressed by Inmarsat, we clarify that the reception of ADS-B 
  
81 We address below Iridium’s requests for waivers of the milestone requirements in section 25.164 and the bond-
posting requirement in section 25.165.
82 See 47 C.F.R. § 87.5 (defining ADS-B Service).  Specifically, ADS-B messages are produced by “ADS-B Out.”  
See 14 C.F.R. § 91.227(a) (defining ADS-B Out); Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out 
Performance Requirements To Support Air Traffic Control (ATC) Service, Docket No. FAA-2007-29305, 75 FR

Out message).  ADS-B is an important component of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Next Generation Air 
Transportation System.  See generally ADS-B Out Rule.
83 The extended squitter is a long message transmitted automatically, without needing to be interrogated by radar, to 
announce the aircraft’s presence to nearby ADS–B equipped aircraft or ground-based air traffic control.  ADS-B Out

or AIS messages on Iridium satellites, and relaying of that information through Iridium feeder links, does 
not alter the rights and obligations of the relevant parties with respect to coordination and protection of 
Iridium feeder links.86 We also find that Iridium has provided sufficient information regarding its 
proposed 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B receiver to process its application.
D. Protection of Radio Astronomy
28. Iridium’s use of the 1617.775-1626.5 MHz band is constrained by section 25.21387 and 
footnote 5.372 of the Table of Frequency Allocations,88 which require protection of stations in the radio 
astronomy service (RAS) operating in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band.  In particular, ITU Resolution 739, 
as revised by WRC-15, addresses the compatibility between the radio astronomy service and satellite 
services in several frequency bands including the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band.
29. Iridium initially proposed to meet these obligations by employing a series of 
configuration changes on its second-generation satellites during RAS collection events.89 CRAF and 
NRAO, representing radio astronomers from Europe and the United States, respectively, objected to the 
protection levels and coordination required by Iridium’s initial proposal.  Subsequently, Iridium 
developed a new plan.  Iridium now proposes to shift traffic from satellites in view of RAS sites onto 
adjacent satellites, thereby limiting spurious emissions into the RAS band.  Iridium states that, using this 
method, it will be able to meet the 2 percent data loss criteria recommended by the ITU for the protection 
of the RAS.90
30. We believe that Iridium’s proposal, if successfully implemented, will be sufficient to 
protect observations of the RAS.  We note, however, that Iridium will remain obliged in section 25.213 to 
take “whatever steps necessary” to avoid causing harmful interference from its downlink operations into 
the U.S. RAS sites listed in section 25.213 during periods of observation.  In addition, we believe that it is 
appropriate to require that all Iridium operations be subject to the terms of the ITU Radio Regulations.
E. Technical Waivers
31. Cross-Polarization Isolation. Iridium requests waiver of section 25.210(i)(1), which 
requires that space station antennas in the FSS, other than those in the 17/24 GHz Broadcasting-Satellite 
Service, be designed to provide a cross-polarization isolation of at least 30 dB within their primary 
coverage area.91 This rule applies to Iridium’s feeder-link and TT&C operations in Ka-band frequencies 
allocated to the FSS.  Iridium states that its second-generation satellites are designed to use feeder-link 
beams with a cross-polarization isolation of 19 dB and TT&C beams with a cross-polarization isolation of

15 dB.92 In support of its waiver request, Iridium states that the cross-polarization isolation for the 
second-generation satellite feeder-link beams is the same cross-polarization isolation used for the 
currently operating satellites.
32. Inmarsat and ViaSat oppose a waiver of section 25.210(i)(1), arguing that Iridium’s 
failure to meet the cross-polarization isolation requirement may make sharing with GSO FSS operations 
in the 29.25-29.3 GHz band more difficult.93 SES does not oppose grant of the waiver, but asks that an 
appropriate condition be placed to protect future, compliant space stations.94
33. We grant Iridium waiver of section 25.210(i)(1).  In the Part 25 Second Report and 
Order, the Commission deleted this requirement as unnecessary.95 While the revised rules have not yet 
come into effect, we do not find a public interest benefit in requiring Iridium to meet a technical 
obligation the Commission has determined is unnecessary.  Accordingly, we waive section 25.210(i)(1), 
and decline to impose the conditions requested by SES.
34. Mid-Band TT&C. Iridium also requests waiver of section 25.202(g) to allow TT&C 
operations throughout its assigned Ka-band feeder-link frequencies.96 Section 25.202(g) requires TT&C 
functions to be conducted “at either or both edges of the allocated band(s).”97 The purpose of the rule is 
to simplify the coordination process for satellite systems, to provide an incentive for the operator to 
maximize the efficiency of its system’s TT&C operations, and to minimize the constraints placed on other 
satellite operations.98
35. Iridium second-generation satellites are designed to perform band-edge TT&C operations 
using omnidirectional antennas on center frequencies of 29.102 GHz, 29.298 GHz, and within 19.4022-
19.4062 GHz when the satellites are in view of Iridium’s feeder-link earth station network.  In addition, 
Iridium plans to embed TT&C information into its normal Ka-band feeder-link operations and transmit 
that information between satellites using its inter-satellite links.  Iridium states that this approach allows it 
to maintain connectivity in real time with every satellite in its constellation, and is a feature of its existing 
constellation.  Iridium also states that its coordination agreements contemplate this TT&C use.  SES does 
not oppose grant of the waiver, but asks that any waiver be accompanied by conditions.99
36. We waive section 25.202(g).  In the Part 25 Second Report and Order, the Commission 
amended section 25.202(g) to permit mid-band TT&C that does not cause additional interference than, 
and does not require additional protection than, normal service traffic.  In accordance with the 
Commission’s current policy in this regard, we waive section 25.202(g) to permit the requested mid-band 
operations.  Iridium will be required to operate its mid-band TT&C in accordance with the revised

99 SES Comments at 3-4.  Specifically, SES asks that we include with any waiver a statement that Iridium’s mid-
band TT&C operations must conform to existing and future coordination agreements, are permitted solely on an 
unprotected and non-harmful interference basis, and must accommodate future satellite networks that comply with 
section 25.202(g).

operational requirement in section 25.202(g).  We believe that this treatment more appropriately balances 
the needs of Iridium and GSO FSS operators than would the strict non-interference condition proposed by 
SES, which is based on earlier Commission policies.
37. Stored Energy at End of Life. Iridium seeks waiver of sections 25.114(d)(14)(ii) and 
25.283(c).  Specifically, Iridium second-generation satellites operate using a single tank with a usable 
volume of 220 liters.  The tank contains an internal bladder.  One side of the bladder membrane is filled 
with 1.5 kg of nitrogen pressurant and is sealed prior to launch.  At end-of-life of a second-generation 
satellite, the nitrogen “dry” side of the membrane will occupy a volume of approximately 219 liters.  
After review of the technical information provided by Iridium, we conclude that waiver of section 
25.283(c) is warranted with respect to this de minimis inert gas.  Iridium also reports that, following fully 
depleting fuel at end-of-life, on the other side of the membrane it anticipates that up to 1.6 kg of 
hydrazine will remain in the propellant lines of the system.  Iridium has properly disclosed its passivation 
plans, and therefore waiver of section 25.114(d)(14)(ii) is unnecessary.
38. Technical Information. Finally, Iridium requests waiver of section 25.114(c)(4)(vi) and 
(vii) to the extent necessary.100 At the time Iridium submitted its Second Generation Application, these 
rules required space station applicants to provide the gain of transponder channels and the predicted 
receiver and transmitter channel filter response characteristics.  Iridium states that this information is 
inapplicable to its satellite design, which uses on-board processors and regenerative payloads.  We agree, 
and therefore find that waiver is unnecessary.  We note in any event that these information requirements 
were deleted from our rules.101
39. In addition, Iridium requests waiver of section 25.114(c)(4)(vi)(B) to omit the 
recommended 2 dB, 4 dB, 6 dB, 8 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB and 20 dB antenna gain contours regarding its VHF 
receiver.102 We have reviewed the technical information provided by Iridium and conclude that these 
additional gain contours are unnecessary for this receiver.
F. Other Matters
40. Processing round, bond and milestones.  As noted above, Iridium seeks to operate using 
ADS-B and AIS frequencies that are not authorized for its current-generation satellites.  This request for 
NGSO-like satellite operation using additional spectrum is potentially subject to consideration in a 
processing round under section 25.157, and any resultant grant for such operation is subject to the bond-
posting requirement in section 25.165 and satisfaction of a milestone schedule set forth in section 25.164.
41. The Commission may waive any rule for good cause.  The purpose of the processing 
round procedure is to prevent one applicant from unreasonably precluding additional entry by other 
operators in the requested frequency band.103 The bond and milestone requirements discourage spectrum 
warehousing.  In this instance, Iridium’s receive-only operations in the ADS-B and AIS bands will not 
preclude any additional satellite operator from receiving the same signals on its own satellite system.  
ADS-B and AIS messages are transmitted under existing, terrestrial wireless licenses and are not for the 
exclusive use of Iridium.  Such transmissions would occur in most cases with or without the presence of 
Iridium satellite receivers.  In addition, we note that Iridium’s new satellites otherwise qualify as 
replacement satellites, which are not subject to the processing round, bond and milestone requirements

indicated above.  Rather, the Commission has expressed confidence that requests for replacement 
satellites will be intended to continue an existing service, rather than being filed for speculative 
purposes.104 Here, Iridium’s initial second-generation satellites, including additional receive frequencies, 
are scheduled for imminent launch.  Because of the nature of ADS-B and AIS automatic transmitters, 
inclusion of the additional receive frequencies on replacement satellites, and unconstrained opportunities 
for additional entry in these services, we find good cause to waive sections 25.157, 25.164, and 25.165 
notwithstanding the eventual protection afforded to Iridium receivers on AIS channels 1 and 2, and 
potentially on additional channels pending future allocations.  Other receive operations on an unprotected 
basis do not raise the potential for warehousing concerns.
42. License Term.  We modify Iridium’s license to specify an extended license term 
applicable to the second-generation satellites, beginning at 3 a.m. Eastern Time on the date when Iridium 
notifies the Commission that operation of an initial second-generation space station is compliant with the 
terms and conditions of this authorization and that the space station has been placed in its authorized 
orbit, and ending 15 years later.105 Because Iridium proposes to remove its first-generation satellites from 
service as they are replaced in orbit by second-generation satellites, those first-generation satellites will 
remain subject to a license term ending on January 31, 2018.
43. Ligado Request.  We decline Ligado’s informal request to hold in abeyance the Iridium 
application.  The issues Ligado raises in this proceeding are derivative of claims that Iridium has made in 
IB Dockets 11-109 and 12-340, and are better suited for treatment in those separate proceedings.106
IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDERING CLAUSES
44. We conclude that grant of Iridium’s application for a second-generation NGSO MSS 
satellite constellation, as conditioned herein, will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.
45. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the application of Iridium Constellation LLC, File 
Nos. SAT-MOD-20131227-00148 and SAT-AMD-20151022-00074, to modify its license for a non-
geostationary-satellite orbit, mobile-satellite service and aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service 
satellite system IS GRANTED, and Iridium Constellation LLC IS AUTHORIZED to construct, deploy 
and operate a constellation of 66 space stations at an altitude of 778 kilometers and arranged in six orbital 
planes, with an inclination of 86.4 degrees.  The initial insertion orbit for Iridium second-generation 
satellites is a 625 km altitude circular orbit with an inclination of 86.66 degrees.  Iridium second-
generation satellites will utilize the following frequency bands, consistent with the operational parameters 
and technical specifications in its application:
a. 156.0125-162.0375 MHz (Earth-to-space) for reception of Automatic Identification 
System, Application Specific Messages, Digital Selective Calling, and maritime distress, 
urgency and safety calling transmissions from maritime vessels;
b. 1087.7-1092.3 MHz (Earth-to-space) for reception of Automatic Dependent 
Surveillance–Broadcast transmissions from aircraft;
c. 1617.775-1618.725 MHz (space-to-Earth and Earth-to-space) for mobile-satellite service 
on a shared basis with the Globalstar system;
d. 1618.725-1626.5 MHz (space-to-Earth and Earth-to-space) for mobile-satellite service on 
an exclusive basis and for aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service in oceanic, polar, 
and remote regions;
